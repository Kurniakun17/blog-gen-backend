## H2: what we mean by \"Shopify chatbot\" [definition] [150 words]

  - H3: typical capabilities (one short paragraph)
    - Real-time product recommendations, order status, refunds/cancellations, add-to-cart buttons in chat, escalate to human agent.
  - H3: what deeper integrations unlock (one short paragraph)
    - When a bot can read Shopify product catalogs and order history it can take real actions rather than only answer questions.

## H2: how we picked the finalists — selection criteria [150 words]
- List and briefly explain each criterion used to choose the five apps:
  - Shopify integration depth (product catalog, order lookup, refunds/actions)
  - Helpdesk integrations and whether the bot can read past tickets
  - Ease of setup (self-serve / one-click vs sales-assisted)
  - Testing tools (simulation or sandbox)
  - Pricing model predictability (flat fee vs per-resolution vs seat)
  - Control and customization (workflow rules, tone, AI actions)
- Short note: criteria are drawn from buyer needs (SMB vs mid-market) and from the verified contexts for each vendor.

## H2: the 5 best AI chatbots (detailed list) [Total for list: 1100 words; ~220 words per item]

- Short intro paragraph: each entry below includes a brief overview, why it made the list, pros/cons (factual from context), pricing (from provided sources) and a screenshot placeholder.

### 1. eesel AI (1) [~220 words]
- One-line overview:
  - An AI platform built to augment existing helpdesks and Shopify stores — designed to slot in without a migration.
- Why it made the list:
  - Truly self-serve, one-click helpdesk integrations, trains on past tickets, robust simulation mode, flat monthly pricing (no per-resolution fees), and Shopify actions supported. See product pages: https://www.eesel.ai/product/ai-chatbot and https://www.eesel.ai/integration/shopify-ai.
- Pros (facts):
  - Self-serve setup — get running in minutes without mandatory sales calls.
  - One-click integrations with Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, Gorgias, and Shopify.
  - Powerful simulation mode to test on historical tickets before going live.
  - Flat monthly plans, predictable billing (no per-resolution fees) — pricing info: Team $299/mo, Business $799/mo (monthly); see https://www.eesel.ai/pricing.
  - Shopify-capable sales chatbot supports order lookup, refunds, add-to-cart in chat, and guided buying flows; deep catalog sync.
- Cons / limitations (factual):
  - Newer compared with some incumbents so third-party review history may be shorter (context note).
  - Focuses on enhancing an existing helpdesk rather than replacing it; if you want a single all-in-one helpdesk + bot replacement you might choose differently.
- Pricing (facts / links):
  - Team: $299/mo (monthly) or $239/mo billed annually; Business: $799/mo or $639/mo annually; Custom available. See https://www.eesel.ai/pricing.

### 2. Gorgias AI Agent [~220 words]
- One-line overview:
  - Gorgias's built-in AI for users already on the Gorgias platform, with tight Shopify action support.
- Why it made the list:
  - Native to the Gorgias helpdesk and able to perform Shopify actions like order edits and refunds; good fit if you live in the Gorgias ecosystem.
- Pros (facts):
  - Deep Shopify action support (order editing, refunds).
  - Native activation inside Gorgias, so the team stays in a familiar workflow.
  - Designed to resolve many common ecommerce support queries automatically.
- Cons / limitations (facts):
  - Pricing is per automated resolution which can make costs unpredictable during spikes; context cites about $1.00 per resolution on monthly plans and $0.90 per resolution on annual plans.
  - No pre-live simulation mode mentioned in provided context, so you cannot fully test on historical tickets in the same way as eesel AI.
  - In-context learning limited to Gorgias data; cannot, per context, pull in external knowledge sources as flexibly as tools built to unify many knowledge sources.
- Pricing (facts / links):
  - Available as part of Gorgias plans with an additional per-resolution charge; see Gorgias docs and pricing referenced in context.
- Screenshot placeholder:
  - [Screenshot: Gorgias AI settings page showing Shopify action triggers — 1200x700]

### 3. Tidio [~220 words]
- One-line overview:
  - All-in-one live chat platform with visual chatbot builder and Shopify integration, popular with small stores.
- Why it made the list:
  - Good visual builder for conversation flows, Shopify product recommendation triggers, and a free tier for experimentation.
- Pros (facts):
  - 30+ chatbot templates and product recommendation triggers tied to browsing behavior (per Tidio content).
  - Free plan and 7-day free trial; accessible starting point for small stores.
  - Integrates with social channels (Instagram, Facebook Messenger).
- Cons / limitations (facts):
  - Integration with helpdesks like Gorgias is mostly hand-off rather than deep two-way learning; Tidio does not train on your past helpdesk tickets per the provided context.
  - Feature complexity may be higher for non-technical users, and advanced plans can get expensive.
- Pricing (facts / links):
  - Free tier available; Starter ~$24.17/mo, Growth ~$49.17/mo; higher tiers listed in the provided context. See https://www.tidio.com/blog/shopify-chatbot/ for the pricing snapshot from the article.

- Why it made the list:
  - Shopify app listing, direct usage inside Shopify admin, clear tiered pricing, and features geared toward sales + support.
- Pros (facts):
  - One-click setup in Shopify admin, auto-sync with product catalog, and customizable branding options.
  - Straightforward pricing tiers on the Shopify app listing: Starter $19/mo, Essentials $49/mo, Scale $99/mo.
  - Designed to be used directly inside Shopify admin for ease of use.
- Cons / limitations (facts):
  - App listing describes product catalog sync and FAQ training; the context does not show simulation on historical helpdesk tickets or advanced per-resolution economics.
  - If you want a helpdesk‑first solution that learns from past tickets (macros, ticket history), the app listing does not claim full past-ticket simulation like eesel AI.
- Pricing (facts / links):
  - Shopify app pricing from listing: Starter $19/mo, Essentials $49/mo, Scale $99/mo. See https://apps.shopify.com/juphy.

  - Lightweight agent builder that lets you train an agent from files and connect to site; recommended when you want a simple, fast agent prototype.
- Why it made the list:
  - Focus on rapid agent creation and a simple content upload/training flow; recommended in context for getting a working agent without heavy setup.
- Pros (facts):
  - Simple data upload model and customizable tone and responses.
  - Easy to get started and create a working agent quickly; Chatbase positions itself for fast, practical agents.
- Cons / limitations (facts):
  - The provided context does not include full pricing details or a granular breakdown of Shopify-specific actions; you should verify Shopify action depth and pricing directly with Chatbase.
  - May require additional work to reach parity with helpdesk-integrated bots that can do refunds or order edits unless those integrations are explicitly configured.
- Pricing (facts / links):
  - Context points to free agent building and signup at https://chatbase.co/auth/signup, but pricing tiers were not listed in the provided excerpt. Flagged as \"check site for commercial pricing\" in the detailed blog.
- Screenshot placeholder:
  - [Screenshot: Chatbase agent creation screen with uploaded docs and sample chat window — 1200x700]

## H2: practical tips for testing and rolling out a Shopify chatbot [100 words]
- Suggested step-by-step mini-checklist (each as short bullet with one-sentence guidance):
  - Start with a narrow scope (order status / returns) and route anything else to humans.
  - Simulate on historical tickets where possible, or run a staged pilot with live chat to internal staff.
  - Measure resolution rate, customer satisfaction, and cost impact; watch for false positives.
  - Provide a clear human-handoff path with context to the agent.
  - Iterate prompts, add missing knowledge to KB, and rerun simulations.

## H2: conclusion and next steps [100 words]
- Quick recap: five vetted choices depending on whether you need tight helpdesk integration, predictable billing, or a lightweight Shopify app.
- Recommendation summary: If you want a bot that augments your existing helpdesk and Shopify store with safe testing and predictable pricing, consider trying eesel AI first (link to https://dashboard.eesel.ai/api/auth/signup?returnTo=v2). If you are fully embedded in Gorgias and want native actions, Gorgias AI Agent is a fit but check per-resolution costs.
- Call to action: Try eesel AI’s free trial and run a simulation on your historical tickets to estimate deflection and ROI (https://dashboard.eesel.ai/api/auth/signup?returnTo=v2). Book a demo if you prefer guided onboarding (https://calendly.com/eesel/30).
