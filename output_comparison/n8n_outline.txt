### **H2: What to look for when choosing your Shopify chatbot** [250 words]

-   This section provides actionable tips to help you make an informed decision.
    -   **Check the training sources and Shopify actions:** Can the bot learn from your entire product catalog, help center, and past tickets? More importantly, can it perform actions? A great chatbot should do more than just talk. Tools like [eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/) allow you to build custom Shopify actions to look up orders, process cancellations, or create returns directly from the chat.
    -   **Understand the pricing model:** Watch out for hidden costs. Some tools charge per ticket (Gorgias) or per AI resolution (Gorgias, Zendesk), which can quickly become expensive and unpredictable. Look for transparent pricing based on interactions or a flat monthly fee so you can scale without surprise bills.
    -   **Test the human escalation path:** A chatbot should never trap a customer. Ensure there's a smooth process for handing off complex conversations to a human agent in your existing helpdesk, whether it's Zendesk, Gorgias, or another platform.
    -   **Evaluate analytics and simulation:** The right tool should give you insights into what customers are asking and where the bot is succeeding. Even better, look for a platform that lets you test its effectiveness beforehand. [eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/) offers a unique simulation feature that runs the AI over your past support tickets to forecast its resolution rate before you even go live.
