            "*   **Meta description**: Looking for the best AI customer support agents in 2025? We tested the top tools to find solutions that automate tickets, integrate seamlessly, and delight users.\n*   **Excerpt**: We dove deep into the world of AI customer service, testing the best AI customer support agents to see which ones actually deliver. Here's our top 5 for 2025.\n*   **Tags**: AI Customer Service, Customer Support Automation, AI Agents, Chatbots\n\n---\n\n# I tried a dozen platforms to find the 5 best AI customer support agents in 2025\n\n[~150 words]\n\nChoosing the right AI for customer support feels like navigating a maze. Every platform promises to slash ticket volumes and make customers happier, but how do you know which one actually works with your existing setup without causing a massive headache? I've been there, spending countless hours on demos and trials, trying to separate the hype from reality.\n\nThat's why I put the top contenders to the test. This isn't just another list scraped from the internet. I've personally explored these platforms to find the best AI customer support agents that deliver on their promises. We’ll look at tools that are easy to set up, powerful enough to handle real customer issues, and flexible enough to fit into your current workflow.\n\n## What are AI customer support agents anyway?\n\n[~200 words]\n\nLet’s clear something up: modern AI customer support agents are much more than the simple, rule-based chatbots of the past. Those old bots could only answer specific questions they were programmed to recognize. Today’s AI agents are powered by generative AI and large language models, allowing them to understand context, handle complex conversations, and, most importantly, _take action_.\n\nThink of them less like a walking FAQ page and more like a junior support agent. They can integrate with your help desk, CRM, and other business tools to perform tasks like looking up order information, processing a return, or triaging a ticket to the right human agent. They learn from your existing knowledge bases, past tickets, and documents to provide personalized, accurate support that matches your brand's voice, 24/7.\n\n## How we picked the best tools\n\n[~150 words]\n\nTo find the best AI customer support agents, we focused on what truly matters for a busy support team. We didn't just look at features; we looked at the real-world impact on workflow and efficiency. Our criteria included:\n\n*   **Ease of implementation**: How quickly and easily can you get the tool up and running? Does it require developers or lengthy sales calls?\n*   **Integration capabilities**: Does the tool work with your existing help desk and knowledge sources, or does it force you to migrate to a new platform?\n*   **Automation power and control**: How well does it handle real customer queries? Can you control which tickets it automates and how it responds?\n*   **Testing and safety**: Can you safely test the AI's performance before letting it talk to customers?\n*   **Pricing transparency**: Is the pricing model clear and predictable, or are there hidden fees like per-resolution costs?\n\n## Quick comparison of the best AI customer support agents\n\n[~50 words]\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the top platforms we tested.\n\n| Tool | Best For | Key Differentiator | Pricing Model |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **eesel AI** | Teams wanting a powerful, self-serve AI that integrates with their existing tools. | Go live in minutes without replacing your help desk; powerful simulation mode. | Per interaction; no per-resolution or per-seat fees. |\n| **Intercom (Fin)** | Businesses looking for an all-in-one customer service suite with a native AI agent. | Deeply integrated into the Intercom platform for a seamless experience. | Per seat + per resolution. |\n| **Zendesk AI** | Companies already committed to the Zendesk ecosystem. | Native integration and ability to leverage existing Zendesk data and workflows. | Per agent (add-on) + per automated resolution. |\n| **Salesforce Einstein** | Large enterprises using Salesforce for their CRM and service operations. | Unmatched integration with Salesforce data for deep personalization. | Per user (add-on to specific plans). |\n| **Forethought** | Companies needing a dedicated, multi-agent AI platform for omnichannel support. | A suite of specialized AI agents (Triage, Solve, Assist) for different tasks. | Custom pricing upon request. |\n\n## A closer look at the 5 best AI customer support agents\n\n[~1000 words]\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into what makes each of these tools stand out and where they might fall short.\n\n### 1. eesel AI\n\n[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of the eesel AI dashboard, showing the easy integration setup or the simulation results.]\n\n[**eesel AI**](https://www.eesel.ai/) is designed for teams that want powerful, flexible AI without having to overhaul their entire tech stack. Its core promise is simplicity and control, allowing you to connect your existing help desk (like Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom) and knowledge sources (Confluence, Google Docs, past tickets) in minutes.\n\nWhat really sets eesel AI apart is its truly self-serve nature. You can sign up, connect your tools, and configure an AI agent without needing to talk to a salesperson. Another standout feature is its powerful simulation mode, which lets you test the AI on thousands of your past tickets. This gives you a clear forecast of its performance and resolution rate before it ever interacts with a live customer, removing the guesswork from implementation. The pricing is also refreshingly transparent, based on interactions rather than charging per resolution, which can penalize you for having an effective bot.\n\nWhile eesel AI is incredibly powerful for self-serve users, companies with highly complex, enterprise-level needs might opt for its AI engineering consulting for a more guided setup. However, for the vast majority of teams looking for a fast, low-risk, and highly effective AI agent, eesel AI's approach is hard to beat. It slots into your workflow, learns from your unique business context instantly, and gives you the granular control needed to automate with confidence.\n\n### 2. Intercom (Fin)\n\n[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Intercom's Fin AI Agent in action within a chat conversation.]\n\nIntercom is a household name in customer engagement, and its AI agent, [**Fin**](https://fin.ai/), is a central part of its all-in-one customer service suite. Fin is powerful, capable of handling complex queries and integrating deeply with the rest of the Intercom platform. It can be trained on your help center content and is designed to provide a seamless experience from chat to resolution.\n\nThe main advantage of Fin is its native integration. If you're already using Intercom for live chat, ticketing, and your help center, Fin feels like a natural extension. It excels at providing smooth handoffs to human agents and maintaining context within conversations. However, this strength is also its biggest limitation. To get the most out of Fin, you really need to be committed to the entire Intercom ecosystem. For teams happy with their current help desk, migrating everything to Intercom is a significant undertaking. The pricing model, which charges both per agent seat and per AI resolution, can also become costly as your automation rates increase.\n\n### 3. Zendesk AI\n\n[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of Zendesk's AI features, such as intelligent triage or Answer Bot suggestions.]\n\nFor the millions of businesses running on Zendesk, [**Zendesk AI**](https://www.zendesk.com/service/ai/) offers the convenience of a native solution. It includes features like intelligent triage to automatically categorize and route tickets, and an Answer Bot that suggests relevant help center articles to customers. More recently, it has expanded to include more advanced generative AI capabilities.\n\nThe biggest pro for Zendesk AI is its seamless integration into the Zendesk Suite. There are no third-party tools to connect; it's all built-in, leveraging your existing macros, triggers, and knowledge base. This makes it a familiar and straightforward choice for established Zendesk customers. On the downside, the most powerful AI features are often part of the higher-tier plans or require a paid add-on, and the pricing includes a per-automated-resolution fee. Furthermore, its capabilities are largely confined to the Zendesk ecosystem, so if your knowledge is scattered across other platforms like Confluence or Google Docs, you may find it less effective at providing comprehensive answers.\n\n### 4. Salesforce Einstein\n\n[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of the Salesforce Service Cloud dashboard with Einstein AI recommendations visible.]\n\n[**Salesforce Einstein**](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/) is the enterprise heavyweight on this list. Built directly into the Salesforce platform, Einstein leverages the vast amount of customer data within your CRM to deliver highly personalized and context-aware service. It can predict customer needs, recommend next steps for agents, and automate routine tasks within Service Cloud.\n\nIts strength lies in its data integration. No other tool can tap into your Salesforce data as effectively, allowing for incredibly sophisticated workflows and personalization. For large organizations already running on Salesforce, it's a logical and powerful choice. However, that power comes with significant complexity and cost. Implementing Einstein is not a simple, self-serve task; it often requires a dedicated team and considerable investment. It’s overkill for most small to medium-sized businesses, and its value is limited if your primary operations aren't centered around the Salesforce ecosystem.\n\n### 5. Forethought\n\n[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of the Forethought platform, perhaps showing the different AI agents available (Solve, Triage, Assist).]\n\n[**Forethought**](https://forethought.ai/ai-agent-for-customer-support/) is a dedicated AI platform that aims to automate the entire customer support lifecycle. It offers a suite of different AI agents: Solve (for automating answers), Triage (for routing tickets), and Assist (for helping human agents). It's known for its strong generative AI capabilities and its ability to integrate with various help desks, including Zendesk and Salesforce.\n\nForethought's multi-agent approach is a key benefit, allowing you to deploy specialized AI for different parts of your workflow. It boasts high resolution rates and can handle inquiries across multiple channels. A potential drawback is that, like many enterprise-focused solutions, getting started typically requires a demo and a more involved sales process. While powerful, it may lack the immediate, self-serve setup and risk-free simulation that platforms like eesel AI offer, making it a bigger initial commitment for teams wanting to test the waters quickly.\n\n## Key things to consider when choosing your AI agent\n\n[~250 words]\n\nChoosing the right tool can feel overwhelming, but focusing on a few key areas can make the decision much clearer.\n\n1.  **Integration vs. Replacement**: First, decide if you want a tool that enhances your current help desk or one that replaces it. Platforms like Intercom and Zendesk work best when you're fully bought into their ecosystem. In contrast, tools like [**eesel AI**](https://www.eesel.ai/) are built to integrate with whatever you already use, offering a more flexible and less disruptive path to automation.\n2.  **Time to Value**: How long will it take to see results? Enterprise solutions like Salesforce Einstein can take months to implement. If you want to start automating tickets this week, look for a self-serve platform that allows you to sign up and get started in minutes.\n3.  **Testing and Simulation**: Don't fly blind. An AI agent is a new member of your team, and you need to know it can do the job before it starts talking to customers. A platform with a robust simulation mode is invaluable, as it lets you measure performance on real historical data and build confidence before going live.\n4.  **Pricing Model**: Pay close attention to how you'll be charged. Per-resolution fees can get expensive quickly and effectively punish you for being successful at automation. A predictable, interaction-based model provides much more clarity and often better value in the long run.\n\n## The right AI agent makes all the difference\n\n[~150 words]\n\nThe goal of adding an AI agent to your customer support team is to make life easier for both your customers and your agents. The best AI customer support agents don't just answer questions, they solve problems, integrate seamlessly with your tools, and give you the confidence to automate more over time.\n\nWhile each tool on this list has its strengths, the right choice depends on your specific needs, budget, and existing tech stack. If you're looking for a solution that's fast to deploy, easy to manage, and works with the tools you already love, it's worth giving a platform with a strong self-serve and simulation offering a try.\n\nReady to see how quickly you can automate your support tickets? [**Try eesel AI**](https://www.eesel.ai/) and you can connect your help desk and simulate your AI agent's performance on your past tickets in just a few minutes.",

            "You are an experienced SEO content writer tasked with creating a comprehensive, engaging, and SEO-optimized blog post for eesel AI. Your writing should explain AI-related topics while subtly promoting eesel AI's services. Aim for a concise, practical, and engaging style that seamlessly integrates eesel AI's advantages within the context of the topic. It should not sound at all AI-like.\n\n\nPlease review the writing guidelines that the blog writers will use. This is important to understand the tone, flow and structure desired.\n\n<writing_tips>\n## **Writing & Content Guidelines**\n      ### 0. Foundational\n      - **Follow the blog outline** strictly to maintain a logical flow.\n      - **Do not use the em dash** - opt for commas or parentheses instead.\n      - Ensure your content is **informative, specific, and actionable** rather than generic or vague or promotional.\n      - **Subtly weave in mentions of the company** where appropriate - highlight its features without overselling. Always link to company websites when doing this.\n      - **Use sentence casing for headings** as that reads more natural and human like, and not as 'overly marketing material'\n      - **Never have a H3 right after a H2 without some text in between** as having a few lines of introductory text in between reads better and less awkward.\n      ### 1. Tone & Voice\n      - Use a **friendly, conversational** tone, as if speaking directly to a single reader.\n      - Maintain **expert authority** yet stay approachable - avoid or define jargon when needed.\n      - Guide the reader with an **informative yet personable** style.\n      - Keep a **conversational yet professional tone** - steer clear of overt marketing fluff.\n      ### 2. Structure & Organization\n      - Start with a **brief introduction** explaining the topic and why it matters.\n      - Arrange content in **clearly labeled sections or subheadings**; move from foundational ideas to deeper insights.\n      - End each piece with a **summary or conclusion** tying everything together.\n      ### 3. Balancing Theory & Practice\n      - Show **why** the topic is important by outlining broad concepts or theories.\n      - Demonstrate **how** to implement ideas with step-by-step instructions, tips, or real-world examples.\n      - Include **personal anecdotes** or case studies to make the information relatable and engaging.\n      ### 4. Interactive and Visual Content Elements\n      - **Incorporate visuals and interactive content elements** to mix up the format and flow:\n        - **Tables** for feature comparisons or concise summaries. Write the table in markdown.\n        - **Mermaid flowcharts** to illustrate complex workflows or processes. Write the flowchart in Mermaid syntax.\n        - **Image placeholders for screenshots** if discussing specific features so readers can see actual app interfaces of configuration screens or end results after set up.\n        - **Image placeholders for infographics** to explain complex topics. Describe the infographic in detail for a human designer to pick up.\n        - **Bullet points** or **numbered lists** for detailed processes, but do not have lists of short, vague phrases. Use bullet points only for truly distinct items so readers can quickly scan them. Combine related points into concise paragraphs to avoid fragmentation. Limit each list to a maximum of five bullet points to prevent overwhelming the reader. Provide transitions around bullet lists to ensure a smooth narrative flow. If needed, add one-sentence explanations under each bullet for extra clarity.\n        - **Pro tips** to highlight extra insights or shortcuts.\n        - **Interactive tools** (at most once in the entire blog) if it enriches the content.\n      - Use **bold** or _italics_ to emphasize key points and aid skimming.\n      ### 5. Clarity & Readability\n      - Write in **short paragraphs** for easy reading.\n      - Use **headings**, **subheadings**, and logical transitions to guide the reader.\n      - Insert **data or statistics** only when they add meaningful context—avoid cluttering with unnecessary details.\n      - Output the text in proper Markdown format with correct indentation. Ensure sub-bullets are indented with a single space or more after the main list number, and preserve spacing consistently to match Markdown syntax for bullet points.\n      ### 6. Credibility & Evidence\n      - **Use only facts** based on the provided context—no invented statistics or unfounded claims.\n      - It is very important to cite **credible sources** when referencing data, statistics or authoritative statements (link to the appropriate Context URL)\n      - Incorporate **quotes or stats** to reinforce claims.\n      - Include **original insights or examples** to bring a unique perspective.\n      ### 7. Conclusion & Next Steps\n      - Summarize the main points in a **concise wrap-up**.\n      - Offer **practical next steps** or a call to action for further exploration.\n      - Provide **links to related resources** if the reader wants to dive deeper.\n      ### 8. SEO & Keyword Optimization\n      - **Incorporate your target keywords**: Use the target keywords provided and include the EXACT KEYWORD MATCH in the title, and headings. Make it sound natural but always have the exact match. Your primary goal is to ensure that the title and headings are grammatically and syntactically ACCURATE. This means that sometimes the exact match keyword may not suit in the title or heading, and it should be broken up by other words to ensure correct syntax. Example: keyword \"salesforce alternative free app\" would not be correct as a heading or title. Instead, you could write: Best Salesforce free app alternatives. This way, the keyword in its entirety is still in the heading, but it is somewhat rearranged and broken up with other words to ENSURE accurate syntax. It must always be in sentence casing, excluding proper nouns like Intercom Fin, etc. Always ensure you refer to product and platform names in their proper spacing and casing.\n      - **Optimize headings and meta information**: Place key terms in headings (H1, H2, H3), the meta title, and meta description to help search engines identify content relevance.\n      - **Balance user intent and search algorithms**: While keywords are essential for SEO, remember that your primary goal is to provide valuable, engaging information that answers readers' questions.\n      - **Ensure internal and external linking**: Link to credible sources or relevant posts (based on context sources or the company websites), which can help search engines crawl and contextualize content.\n\n</writing_tips>\n\nYou must use the following general context to inform all information about a product or platform. Ensure you read it in its entirety.\n\n<general_context>\n<company_profile>\n\neesel AI is an AI platform for customer service, ITSM, and internal knowledge. It plugs into help desks (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, Jira, Gorgias, etc.), chat tools (Slack, MS Teams), and your knowledge sources (help centers, past tickets, macros, Google Docs, Confluence, PDFs, Shopify, more) to automate frontline support, draft agent replies, triage tickets, power internal Q&A, and embed customer‑facing chatbots—all without forcing a migration of your tools like your helpdesk. ---\nThings to remember when describing eesel AI. Index more on the points that are most relevant to the topic and what's being talked about in each section. THESE ARE ALL HIGH PRIORITY, with sub points being less important that main points.\n\n### 1. Go live in minutes, not months: Radically self-serve & simple\n\n  * **Truly self-serve:** Forget lengthy onboarding, sales calls, and mandatory demos. You can set up, configure, and launch your eesel AI copilots and agents entirely on your own. Almost every competitor requires a sales call to even get a demo of the product whereas you can get set up with a basic Ai chat over your helpdesk in eesel AI - for free - and in literally minutes. You can also get AI engineering consulting for more advanced set ups but many customers are able to self serve and get going on their own with the eesel AI dashboard. \n\n  * **One-click helpdesk integration:** Instantly connect to Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, Gorgias, and more. There's no complex API work or developer time required and eesel AI can slot into your existing helpdesk workflows really seamlessly. \n\n  * **Simulate and roll out gradually:**With eesel AI, you can simulate the AI over past tickets and easily identify exactly which kinds of tickets you can automate away easily. You can see how it's performing and adjust the prompts and actions it can take accordingly. You can get it to handle only a specific type of tickets to start and escalate all other tickets, and as you build confidence get it to handle more and more. These simulations are much more robust and ahead of the curve than any other players in the market. \n\n### 2. Total control: A fully customizable workflow engine\n\n  * **Selective automation:** Choose precisely which tickets the AI handles. Start with simple T1 topics and confidently escalate everything else, or create complex rules based on ticket type, customer, or content. Unlike some AI platforms who can use rigid rules or keywords, eesel AI gives you granular control over what gets automated and what doesn't.\n\n  * **Customizable AI persona & actions:** Go beyond simple answers. Use the eesel AI prompt editor to define the AI's tone of voice, personality, and the specific actions it can take—from looking up order information in real-time to updating ticket fields. Custom actions are supported so your eesel AI can look up any information in any system you have. It can also take actions like escalate, triage tickets and more. With eesel AI, you can get set up on your own and it's still incredibly powerful. \n\n  * **Scoped knowledge:** Easily limit the AI to specific sets of topics or knowledge sources for different contexts, ensuring it only answers what it's supposed to. eesel AI stays within your defined boundaries and is hyper personalised.\n\n### 3. Unify your knowledge, instantly\n\n  * **Train on past tickets:** eesel AI analyzes your historical support conversations to understand context, brand voice, and common solutions from day one. eesel AI learns your specific business context automatically.\n\n  * **Automated knowledge base generation:** Turn successful ticket resolutions into draft articles for your knowledge base automatically, helping you identify and close information gaps with content that's proven to be useful.\n\n  * **Connect all your sources:** Go beyond the helpdesk. Seamlessly integrate knowledge from Google Docs, Confluence, Notion, and more. You can even deploy eesel AI in Slack for powerful internal AI chat. \n\n### 4. Test with confidence: Risk-free simulation & reporting\n\n  * **Powerful simulation mode:** Safely test your AI setup on thousands of historical tickets in a sandbox environment. Preview responses, and get accurate forecasts on resolution rates and cost savings before activating for customers. \n\n  * **Actionable reporting:** Our analytics dashboard doesn't just show you what the AI did; it highlights gaps in your knowledge base and identifies trends, providing a clear roadmap for improvement. eesel AI gives you actionable insights to continuously improve your support operations.\n\n### 5. Transparent pricing\n\n  * **No per-resolution fees:** Our plans are based on the features and overall capacity you need. Pay-per-interaction for complete clarity on how much each conversation is costing. No cost per agent/seat.\n\n  * **Flexible plans:** Choose a month-to-month plan you can cancel anytime, or get a 20% discount with an annual subscription. eesel AI offers transparent, predictable pricing with no hidden costs. You can even get started on the monthly plan and cancel any time.\n\n\n\n\n  ---\nProducts\n### AI Agent\n\n  Autonomous frontline support in your help desk.

Below, I explore the key trends shaping the future of AI chatbots.\n\n- **Emotionally Intelligent Responses**: Advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities enable chatbots to understand and respond to the emotional tone of customer inquiries. This evolution addresses the need for more empathetic and contextually relevant customer interactions, leading to higher satisfaction rates.\n- **Voice-Enabled Conversational Interfaces**: The integration of voice recognition allows users to interact with chatbots using natural speech, making technology more accessible and aligning with the use of voice-assisted devices.\n- **AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation**: Ethical AI practices can counteract bias in chatbot interactions.

When selecting a plan, consider not only the current needs of your business but also future growth, ensuring that the chosen solution can scale as your customer service demands evolve.\n\n### How do I choose the right AI chatbot for my support channels?\n\nStart by listing your current support channels (chat, email, social, etc.) and the types of customer inquiries you handle. Look for AI chatbots that support your primary channels and integrate with your CRM or helpdesk tools. Assess each vendor’s ability to handle complexity, language support, and automation depth. Ask vendors for case studies relevant to your industry—don’t rely on generic demos.\n\n### What integrations should I look for in customer service chatbots?\n\nYou should prioritize integrations with your CRM, helpdesk, live chat platform, and knowledge base. Also check for support with calendar, ticketing, and eCommerce systems if relevant. Smooth integration ensures your chatbot can resolve cases efficiently, personalize customer interactions, and automate workflows seamlessly for your team.\n\n### What are the advantages of using AI chatbots for customer service?\n\nModern consumers don’t want to wait to receive answers to their questions. When they hit a blockade, customers simply move on to the next business. This is the main advantage of having AI customer service chatbots ready and able to answer basic customer queries or escalate issues 24/7.\n\nAI-powered chatbots can also help your business with lead generation by collecting user’s contact information on the spot. The data collected by chatbots can be used as learning material for both the chatbot and the company.\n\n### How can I ensure my AI chatbot delivers personalized customer experiences?\n\nTrain your chatbot using customer data from your CRM and feedback. Create detailed intent libraries and use conversation flows that reference purchase history or past interactions. Regularly review bot transcripts for areas to fine-tune answers. Consider platforms with advanced natural language processing to recognize returning customers and personalize greetings or offers.\n\n### What security or compliance standards should chatbots meet for customer service?\n\nLook for chatbots that offer end-to-end encryption, GDPR or CCPA compliance, and strong data access controls. Review the vendor’s security documentation and ask if they’ve completed SOC 2, ISO 27001, or similar audits. For sensitive industries, ensure the solution supports custom retention policies and audit trails.\n\n### How long does it take to implement an AI chatbot in a typical customer service environment?\n\nMost AI chatbot implementations take 2–8 weeks depending on your support volume and integration needs. Simple FAQ bots can go live in days, while complex, multi-channel deployments may need testing and training. Involve both your CX and IT teams early to speed up onboarding and cut down on surprises.\n\n### How do AI and machine-learning-based chatbots differ from rule-based chatbots?\n\nAI chatbots use natural language processing and machine learning to understand and respond to customer queries, even if questions are phrased in new ways. Rule-based bots follow pre-set decision trees and only recognize specific keywords or phrases. For CX leaders, AI chatbots are better at handling variety, while rule-based bots are simpler but less flexible.\n\n### How can I measure the ROI of using an AI-based chatbot for customer service?\n\nMeasure ROI by tracking support ticket deflection, reduction in response times, and agent workload before and after chatbot deployment. Also measure customer satisfaction and NPS scores. Use cost savings (fewer agents, shorter handling times) and improved retention as key financial indicators for your business case.\n\n### What are the downsides and limitations to using AI chatbots in customer service?\n\nAI chatbots may misunderstand context, struggle with complex requests, or require ongoing maintenance. Poorly trained bots can frustrate customers. You’ll also need to manage data privacy, security, and escalation to live agents. Start small, monitor performance, and commit to iterative improvement for best results.\n\n## Use an AI-Powered Chatbot to Take Your Customer Service to the Next Level\n\nAny business or organization that still believes in human interactions as the only approach to customer relationship management probably hasn’t seen the numbers. It’s expected that up to [85%](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/10/10-reasons-ai-powered-automated-customer-service-future/https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/10/10-reasons-ai-powered-automated-customer-service-future/) of customer interactions are already being managed without involving human agents, be it an AI assistant or otherwise.\n\nTo stay in the loop of the latest advances in using AI tools for customer service, consider [signing up for our newsletter](https://thecxlead.com/subscribe/).

For instance, imagine a customer contacting a company's support team with a complex issue. The AI system, using machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics, quickly understands the problem and provides a personalized solution. This starkly contrasts the traditional method, where the customer had to wait for a human agent to understand the issue and then offer a solution.\n\nFrom chatbots handling routine questions to AI-driven analytics predicting customer needs, this tech is transforming the customer experience. HubSpot’s State of AI Survey shows that [71% of customer support specialists agree](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=71-of-customer-support-specialists-agree) that AI/automation tools can help improve customers' overall experience with their company.\n\nAI customer service software aims to elevate the customer experience by reducing wait times, providing accurate information, and personalizing interactions. With AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants, customers can get immediate responses instead of being put on hold. These intelligent tools can handle everything from answering FAQs to troubleshooting issues, freeing up human agents to tackle more complex problems.\n\nAn AI customer service platform isn‘t just about automating tasks — it’s about creating a seamless, satisfying customer journey. Let's dive into how it works and the top solutions available in the market today.\n\n![reasons to use ai customer service software](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/I6tF65MwIV05wvF7XsTC7-49CWs4nSvEe8KGHI_MvKKOyHola_kXbBNtpIw_X5Wsy5SGfZ2xXYwvrynbe9IsE_4jRBVIW_k-dITZYBf4ambtGfWAYFC4wmru1pUy4_iPKiBRse9JJIWrSEpyQKawqaE)\n\n### Why use AI customer service software?\n\n#### Improved Response Time\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of AI customer service software is the drastic reduction in response time. I’ve seen firsthand how AI-powered chatbots can handle multiple inquiries simultaneously, providing instant responses that keep customers satisfied.\n\nAccording to HubSpot’s research from the State of Service 2024 report, 80% of customers expect their service tickets and requests to be resolved immediately.\n\nThis expectation is well met with AI, as 46% of service professionals using AI customer service platforms report significantly improved response times, and another 46% report somewhat improved response times.\n\nAI ensures your business can meet these expectations, significantly improving overall customer satisfaction.\n\n**FYI:** The Help Desk provides an AI-powered ticketing workspace for efficient case management.\n\n#### 24/7 Availability\n\nAI doesn’t need to sleep. One of the game-changing aspects of AI customer service software is its ability to provide support around the clock. We’ve all experienced how frustrating it can be to need help outside of regular business hours and not get it.\n\nAI eliminates this problem by offering 24/7 support, ensuring customers can get assistance whenever needed, which is especially helpful for businesses with a global customer base. For example, Breeze Customer Agent provides 24/7 automated customer support to scale support teams.\n\nAccording to Salesforce’s State of the Connected Customer report, [77% of customers](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-the-connected-customer/?d=cta-body-promo-1) expect to interact with someone immediately when they contact a company. An AI customer service platform meets this demand, ensuring that every customer query is answered, regardless of the time of day.\n\n#### Enhanced Personalization\n\nI’ve always valued customer service that feels personal, and AI customer service software takes this to the next level. AI systems can help by analyzing customer data to provide customized responses and recommendations, significantly enhancing the customer experience. I've seen how AI can remember past conversations and preferences from my interactions, making every exchange feel unique and customized.\n\nAccording to Zendesk, [59% of customers](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=59-of-customers) think businesses should personalize their experiences based on the data they’re collecting on them. And according to HubSpot data from the State of Service 2024 report, 78% of customer service professionals say customers expect more personalization than ever before.\n\nWith AI, businesses can deliver more personalized, engaging experiences that make customers feel understood and valued throughout their journey.\n\n#### Increased Efficiency\n\nEfficiency is another major advantage I’ve observed with AI customer service software.\n\nAI is great at handling routine tasks, which means human agents can concentrate on more complex issues that need a personal touch. This not only speeds up the resolution process but also reduces operational costs.\n\nHubSpot's findings indicate that businesses using AI for customer service can handle a higher volume of queries without compromising quality, improving overall efficiency. According to HubSpot's State of AI Survey, [78% of customer support specialists agree](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=78-of-customer-support-specialists-agree) that AI/automation tools can help them be more efficient.\n\n#### Data-Driven Insights\n\nFinally, AI customer service software provides invaluable data-driven insights by analyzing customer interactions to identify common issues and trends. These insights inform business strategies and decision-making. For example, businesses can track customer sentiment, common issues, and agent performance with [HubSpot’s AI features](https://www.hubspot.com/products/artificial-intelligence?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=hubspots-ai-features&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_post-cta=hubspots-ai-features).\n\nAccording to HubSpot’s State of AI Survey, [42% of customer service pros](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-service-stats?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=42-of-customer-service-pros) using AI tools to collect and analyze feedback report significant improvements in customer experience. This capability allows businesses to proactively address problems and enhance their services.\n\n**Pro tip**: Some AI platforms highlight unresolved customer questions, helping identify content gaps that need addressing.\n\nBy incorporating AI into your customer service strategy, you can harness these benefits to improve the customer experience, increase efficiency, and foster greater satisfaction and loyalty. Tools such as [HubSpot's AI-powered Service Hub](https://www.hubspot.com/products/service?hubs_post-cta=EN-blog-pm&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=hubspots-ai-powered-service-hub&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software) offer extensive features to help businesses efficiently manage customer interactions.\n\n### How can AI help customer service?\n\nAI can help customer service in many ways. For example, HubSpot’s Service Hub can save you time by generating your knowledge base articles for you and routing help tickets to the best support rep. Plus, [HubSpot’s Breeze customer agent](https://www.hubspot.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-customer-service-agent?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=hubspots-breeze-customer-agent&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_post-cta=hubspots-breeze-customer-agent) acts as a 24/7 concierge. It can help website visitors sign up for your newsletter, answer common questions about pricing, and resolve customer order issues. Teams using HubSpot's AI customer agent have seen 39% faster ticket resolution than teams that don't use it.\n\n## Transforming Customer Service With AI: Key Takeaways\n\nExploring AI customer service software has shown me just how transformative these tools can be. AI dramatically improves response times and ensures 24/7 availability, which is crucial for meeting modern customer expectations. The ability to personalize interactions and gain deep insights into customer behavior is particularly impressive.\n\nAmong the top tools, [HubSpot’s Service Hub](https://www.hubspot.com/products/service?hubs_post-cta=EN-blog-pm&hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software&hubs_content-cta=hubspots-service-hub&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/service/ai-customer-service-software) stands out as my favorite. Its user-friendly interface, seamless integration with other HubSpot tools, and comprehensive features make it an excellent choice for small to medium businesses. The AI-powered analytics and automation capabilities significantly enhance service quality and efficiency.\n\nAnother standout is Intercom’s Fin AI, which excels in handling complex customer interactions with intuitive design and customization options. Its advanced features, like A/B testing and detailed analytics, allow businesses to continually optimize their customer service strategies.\n\nAI adoption in customer service isn’t simply a trend; it’s a shift in how businesses engage and provide support. By improving efficiency, tailoring experiences, and proactively solving problems, AI sets a higher standard for delivering outstanding service.\n\n[![New

service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/) agents are intelligent technology that can understand and respond to customer inquiries within the guardrails the agent is provided. [AI agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/) can handle simple or complex issues, such as answering a frequently asked question or managing a product return, in a personalized and conversational way.\n\nOur research finds that [82% of service reps](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-service/) say customers ask for more than they used to. As a [customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/what-is-customer-service/) leader, you’re likely under pressure to deliver on these expectations while reducing costs, increasing speed, and offering personalized, around-the-clock service. That's when AI customer service agents can lend support.\n\nLet's explore the benefits of this technology, especially how it can enhance your organization's service operations, the customer experience, and overall productivity and efficiency.\n\n- [What are AI customer service agents?](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/customer-service-agents/#what-are)\n- [Why are AI-powered customer service agents important?](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/customer-service-agents/#why-are)\n- [Benefits of AI customer service agents](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/customer-service-agents/#benefits)\n- [Why choose Agentforce Service Agent as your AI customer service agent solution](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/customer-service-agents/#why-choose)\n\n![Service Prep Guide](https://wp.sfdcdigital.com/en-us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/ASA_Gated_CTA.png?w=1024)\n\n[Get the guide](https://www.salesforce.com/form/service-cloud/prepare-for-digital-labor/?d=pb)\n\n[AI customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/customer-service-ai/) agents are virtual assistants that can interact with your customers and support your service operations. They rely on [machine learning](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/cdabaso/trailmixes/machine-learning-with-salesforce) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/natural-language-processing-basics) to handle a wide range of tasks, from answering simple questions to resolving complex issues — even multitasking. Most importantly, AI customer service agents can continuously improve their own performance through self-learning.\n\n[AI-powered customer service technology](https://www.salesforce.com/service/ai/) has gained prominence for a few reasons:\n\n- **Rising customer expectations:** Our research finds that [80% of customers](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-the-connected-customer/) say that a company's experience is as important as its products and services. These expectations grow as faster and more personalized service becomes the norm. Agents are available 24/7, making it quicker and easier to meet these demands.\n- **Increased desire for personalization:** Customers want faster, more personalized service, and it's up to companies to keep up. Our research finds that [65% of customers](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-service/) expect companies to adapt to their changing needs and preferences.AI can analyze customer history — including behavior and preferences — to personalize [customer support](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-support/) and even predict future actions. AI customer service agents can pull customer information from a company’s [CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/) to address specific needs and maintain accuracy and consistency during interactions.\n- **Shared knowledge:** AI can use [knowledge management](https://www.salesforce.com/service/what-is-knowledge-management/) systems to provide your customer service team with instant access to relevant information, enabling faster, more accurate responses and improving overall customer satisfaction. [Generative AI](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/three-ways-service-impact-generative-ai/) can even draft [knowledge base articles](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/how-to-write-a-knowledge-base-article/) for your team. Agents can use this organizational knowledge to generate accurate, conversational responses based on the knowledge base. Our research finds that 61% of customers would [rather use self-service](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-the-connected-customer/) for simple issues, so technology like agents can help companies improve customer satisfaction while reducing costs.\n- **Rep burnout:** Our research also finds that [56% of customer service reps](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-service/) report experiencing [burnout](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/call-center-burnout/). This comes from things like increased customer demands and expectations, short-staffed teams, and repetitive work like answering the same questions over and over. Agents can take some of the pressure off your reps’ plates by freeing them up to focus on issues where human intervention and empathy are required.\n\nAI customer service agents help ensure service teams always have enough support to handle increases in [service channels](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/digital-customer-service-channels/) and evolving customer needs. They can take simple, routine tasks off human reps' plates, and provide them with extra support to increase efficiency and build customer trust and satisfaction.\n\nHere's a look at some of the benefits they provide:\n\n- **Enhanced efficiency:** AI customer service agents can handle multiple customer interactions simultaneously, significantly reducing response times and increasing the efficiency of [customer service operations.](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-service-incident-management/customer-service-operations/) This allows businesses to handle higher volumes of inquiries without compromising on the quality of service.\n- **Improved customer satisfaction:** AI customer service agents provide quick and accurate responses, leading to higher [customer satisfaction scores](https://www.salesforce.com/service/customer-service-incident-management/customer-satisfaction-score/) (CSAT). They can use data to personalize interactions, enhancing the overall [customer experience](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-is-customer-experience/). And because they learn over time, they're geared toward continuous improvement.\n- **24/7 availability:** AI customer service agents are available around the clock, ensuring customer inquiries are addressed quickly. This continuous availability helps businesses meet customer expectations for [self-service](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/self-service-customer-service/) and improves customer loyalty.\n- **Scalability:** AI customer service agents can easily scale to handle increased volumes of customer interactions, making them ideal for businesses looking to grow without compromising service quality. As case volume increases, they can be easily adjusted to handle the additional load, ensuring consistent and reliable support.\n- **Data-driven insights:** AI customer service agents generate valuable data on customer interactions, preferences, and behaviors. Businesses can use this data to gain insights into customer needs and trends.\n- **Consistency**: AI customer service agents provide consistent responses to customer inquiries, helping to build trust and confidence in the brand.\n\nThese advanced AI solutions can help businesses stay ahead and drive innovation for [customer engagement](https://www.salesforce.com/service/digital-customer-engagement-platform/what-is-customer-engagement/).\n\nIf you're looking to integrate AI customer service agents into your customer service strategy, Agentforce Service Agent can help. Here’s how:\n\n- **Multi-channel support**: Engage customers 24/7 through various channels like SMS, [WhatsApp](https://www.salesforce.com/service/contact-center/whatsapp-for-customer-service/), and Facebook Messenger, as well as [voice](https://www.salesforce.com/service/call-center-integration/) for inbound calls. This ensures customers get seamless, consistent, and conversational support across their preferred communications, enhancing accessibility and convenience.\n- **Multi-modal understanding:** Enables AI to interpret and respond to various input types, such as text, images, and audio, using advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing and computer vision. This capability allows the agent to extract relevant information from different formats, providing more accurate and contextually appropriate responses to customers.\n- **Agent Builder:** Agentforce Service Agent can be personalized using the Agent Builder, a user-friendly, low-code tool. With Agent Builder, users can use existing tools like Flows, prompt templates from [Prompt Builder](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/prompt-builder/), Apex, and APIs to configure their agent. The setup process is straightforward: define the agent's tasks by specifying topics, provide natural language instructions for each topic, and create a library of actions for the agent to select from. Agent Builder also allows for easy monitoring of an agent's plan of action and testing of its responses, all within the builder itself.\n- **Atlas Reasoning Engine:** The Atlas Reasoning Engine serves as the ‘brain’ behind Agentforce, using a proprietary system that emulates human thought and planning. It begins by analyzing user queries, enhancing them for clarity and relevance. It then gathers the most pertinent data and formulates an action plan. This plan undergoes further refinement to ensure accuracy, relevance, and reliability based on trusted data sources. This sophisticated reasoning process enables Agentforce to autonomously make decisions, solve problems, and carry out business tasks, all while providing precise and factually correct outcomes.\n- **Service Cloud integration and interoperability**: Agentforce Service Agent and [Service Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/service/cloud/) are both natively built on the Salesforce platform, enabling seamless integration and facilitating real-time data exchange and synchronization. This integration allows agents to access and update customer records directly within Service Cloud and seamlessly hand off support to reps, enhancing support efficiency and accuracy.\n- **product.data integration:** Agentforce Service Agent integrates with Data 360 to access and use comprehensive customer data, enabling personalized and contextually relevant interactions.

the whole customer journey. A future that opens the door to a previously-unimaginable level of customer experience.\n\n[Learn more](https://fin.ai/customer-agent)</content>\n</context>\n</general_context>\n\nWhen talking about a competitor's limitations, you SHOULD be really SPECIFIC with the facts stated in the context and DO NOT exaggerate limitations just to make the company look better.\n\nHere is specific information about the company's value proposition, features, and differentiators.\n\n<company_context>\n\neesel AI is an AI platform for customer service, ITSM, and internal knowledge. It plugs into help desks (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, Jira, Gorgias, etc.), chat tools (Slack, MS Teams), and your knowledge sources (help centers, past tickets, macros, Google Docs, Confluence, PDFs, Shopify, more) to automate frontline support, draft agent replies, triage tickets, power internal Q&A, and embed customer‑facing chatbots—all without forcing a migration of your tools like your helpdesk. ---\nThings to remember when describing eesel AI. Index more on the points that are most relevant to the topic and what's being talked about in each section. THESE ARE ALL HIGH PRIORITY, with sub points being less important that main points.\n\n### 1. Go live in minutes, not months: Radically self-serve & simple\n\n  * **Truly self-serve:** Forget lengthy onboarding, sales calls, and mandatory demos. You can set up, configure, and launch your eesel AI copilots and agents entirely on your own. Almost every competitor requires a sales call to even get a demo of the product whereas you can get set up with a basic Ai chat over your helpdesk in eesel AI - for free - and in literally minutes. You can also get AI engineering consulting for more advanced set ups but many customers are able to self serve and get going on their own with the eesel AI dashboard. \n\n  * **One-click helpdesk integration:** Instantly connect to Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom, Gorgias, and more. There's no complex API work or developer time required and eesel AI can slot into your existing helpdesk workflows really seamlessly. \n\n  * **Simulate and roll out gradually:**With eesel AI, you can simulate the AI over past tickets and easily identify exactly which kinds of tickets you can automate away easily. You can see how it's performing and adjust the prompts and actions it can take accordingly. You can get it to handle only a specific type of tickets to start and escalate all other tickets, and as you build confidence get it to handle more and more. These simulations are much more robust and ahead of the curve than any other players in the market. \n\n### 2. Total control: A fully customizable workflow engine\n\n  * **Selective automation:** Choose precisely which tickets the AI handles. Start with simple T1 topics and confidently escalate everything else, or create complex rules based on ticket type, customer, or content. Unlike some AI platforms who can use rigid rules or keywords, eesel AI gives you granular control over what gets automated and what doesn't.\n\n  * **Customizable AI persona & actions:** Go beyond simple answers. Use the eesel AI prompt editor to define the AI's tone of voice, personality, and the specific actions it can take—from looking up order information in real-time to updating ticket fields. Custom actions are supported so your eesel AI can look up any information in any system you have. It can also take actions like escalate, triage tickets and more. With eesel AI, you can get set up on your own and it's still incredibly powerful. \n\n  * **Scoped knowledge:** Easily limit the AI to specific sets of topics or knowledge sources for different contexts, ensuring it only answers what it's supposed to. eesel AI stays within your defined boundaries and is hyper personalised.\n\n### 3. Unify your knowledge, instantly\n\n  * **Train on past tickets:** eesel AI analyzes your historical support conversations to understand context, brand voice, and common solutions from day one. eesel AI learns your specific business context automatically.\n\n  * **Automated knowledge base generation:** Turn successful ticket resolutions into draft articles for your knowledge base automatically, helping you identify and close information gaps with content that's proven to be useful.\n\n  * **Connect all your sources:** Go beyond the helpdesk. Seamlessly integrate knowledge from Google Docs, Confluence, Notion, and more. You can even deploy eesel AI in Slack for powerful internal AI chat. \n\n### 4. Test with confidence: Risk-free simulation & reporting\n\n  * **Powerful simulation mode:** Safely test your AI setup on thousands of historical tickets in a sandbox environment. Preview responses, and get accurate forecasts on resolution rates and cost savings before activating for customers. \n\n  * **Actionable reporting:** Our analytics dashboard doesn't just show you what the AI did; it highlights gaps in your knowledge base and identifies trends, providing a clear roadmap for improvement. eesel AI gives you actionable insights to continuously improve your support operations.\n\n### 5. Transparent pricing\n\n  * **No per-resolution fees:** Our plans are based on the features and overall capacity you need. Pay-per-interaction for complete clarity on how much each conversation is costing.

Each item in the list could be an idea, a product, an app, or something similar. They need to be *real* and not made up. \n      \n      The title of the blog MUST contain \"2025\" as an indication of this being the latest, most up to date information. Create a variation of the title with a more personal and relatable angle, something that feels like a first-hand experience or personal story. For example: I tried 17 ChatGPT alternatives to find the best chatbot in 2025.\n      \n      Your listicle must contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – short and to the point, explaining the reason for the list and what will be included in the blog.\n      2. A section explaining the definition of the items, products, or apps that you're listing.\n      3. Optional: A section explaining their benefits and use cases.\n      4. A section explaining the criteria for the list items.\n      5. A table comparing all list items to each other with relevant columns.\n      6. A full list (ONLY between 5-7 items AND NOT MORE, matching the title of the blog).\n      6a. Each list item needs to be numbered. company name should always be at the top of this list if it's relevant. The keyword should NOT be included in one of the list. The list items should have the same information included in each, and should be detailed but not exhaustive. For example, if the list were about AI platforms for help desks, each item should have a pros and cons list, a pricing section, and a short description of why we included it on the list and potential use cases.\n      6b. All items on the list must include a screenshot asset.\n      7. A table comparing all list items to each other.\n      8. A section that contains tips or extra info that helps inform readers about the topic or choosing from the list.\n      9. A conclusion and CTA for company name.\n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **How-To Guide**\n      A how-to blog is a practical, step-by-step guide designed to help the reader complete a specific task or process. It should focus on clarity and ease of execution.\n      \n      Your how-to blog should contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – short and to the point, clearly explaining what the reader will learn to do and why it matters. Always include a screenshot suggestion here.\n      2. A \"What You'll Need\" section or something similar – this includes any tools, platforms, accounts, or prerequisites required before starting.\n      3. A numbered list of steps – each step should be:\n         1. Clearly labeled with a heading.\n         2. Actionable, with no skipped logic.\n         3. Explained in 1–3 paragraphs max.\n         4. Supplemented with screenshots or visuals if applicable.\n      4. A section with tips or common mistakes  – this helps reinforce successful execution.\n      5. A conclusion – briefly summarise what was accomplished and encourage the reader to try it.\n      6. A CTA for company name – ideally tying back to how company name can support the task covered.\n      \n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **Overview**\n      An overview is a detailed, strategic overview that helps the reader understand and act on a broad topic. Unlike a how-to, it focuses more on what and why. Unlike listicles, it SHOULD NOT bring up title or content that feels like a first-hand experience or personal story. Make sure throughout the blog you are highlighting limitations or downsides of competitor AI platforms, and suggesting company name as an alternative. Dedicate less time to explaining walk throughs of setups, and more time to explaining features and limitations, and suggesting company name.\n      \n      Your guide should contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – sets the context for the topic and defines the scope. The intro should always have a screenshot asset suggestion relevant to the topic.\n      2. A what is section – introduce and explain the keyword. If the keyword contains “vs”, explain each tool separately. For example, for “Zendesk vs Intercom”, the section should include “What is Zendesk” and “What is Intercom”.\n      3. Three detailed sections on the main components of the topic – group these logically under clear headings. Always include at least one asset for each section.\n         - For example, if the guide is about AI in support, sections might include Setup, Use Cases, limitations, and Measurement.\n      4. Pricing is mandatory and must be provided in FULL, COMPLETE PLANS, directly from the official pricing page. DO NOT skip, estimate, or partially include it.\n      5. A conclusion – recap the main points and include a visual summary if helpful.\n      6. A CTA for company name – connect how company name fits into the guide's topic or solves part of the outlined challenge.\n      \n      Always include links to relevant sites whenever something with a link is mentioned.\n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **News**\n      \n      News pieces need to be very short (500-750 words) and be factual and concise. Use the following template to help inform your news post and adapt it to your topic and keyword.\n      \n      1. Headline/Title: Concisely state the piece of news including a key benefit or impact/interesting spin.\n      2. Explain the news or update factually and concisely. Use links to sources, and quotes, at every appropriate opportunity.\n      3. Why it matters section to help connect this to relevant topics for company name AI or other AI topics.\n      4. Who this affects to explain briefly the key stakeholders or groups of people/companies that will most likely be impacted by it\n      5. What's next includes what that impact might look like or suggested upcoming similar events\n      6. Conclusion and CTA to company name - relate the topic to company name in some way.\n      \n      Your news article relies on being considered 'trustworthy', so ensure you include quotes, links, and sources where you can.\n      \n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **Review**\n      \n      A review blog evaluates a product, tool, or service. It should be structured, transparent, and helpful for decision-making.\n      \n      Create a variation of the title with a more personal and relatable angle, something that feels like a first-hand experience or personal story. For example: My honest Pipedrive review after using it for 16+ months\n      \n      Your review should contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – briefly explain what's being reviewed and why it's relevant to your audience. This should always have a screenshot asset suggestion of the relevant thing being reviewed.\n      2. A specs/overview section – include key facts like pricing, features, supported platforms, and ideal users. Use tables where appropriate.\n      3. A breakdown by criteria – use consistent subheadings (e.g., Usability, Integrations, Support, Value for Money).\n         - Each section should include pros, cons, and an overall take.\n      4. A table summarising all the reviewed criteria – include scores or ratings if applicable.\n      6. A final verdict – who it's best for, and if it's worth it.\n\n\n</blog_type_definitions>\n\nHere is the word count:\n\n<word_count>\n2000\n</word_count>\n\nHere are the target keywords:\n\n<target_keywords>\nbest ai customer support agents\n</target_keywords>\n\nThe blog will NOT use marketing fluff but speak how someone would speak verbally in a work setting that is casual but professional. Avoid being cocky, snarky, or overly negative. Just state the facts and observations clearly. Explain missing pricing or missing documentation without judgment.\n\nBefore creating the final outline, prepare the outline:\n1. List and prioritize key SEO keywords from the context and topic.\n2. Break down the topic into logical sections.\n3. Create an intuitive and logical structure for the outline.\n4. Identify opportunities to subtly highlight eesel AI's advantages.\n5. Make sure you explicitly have H1, H2, H3 headings and the key points to make for each part\n\nAfter your preparation, create a detailed blog outline:\n- Forms the perfect outline for a blog that will be written in accordance with the writing tips\n- Is clear, logical, and easy to understand for a non-technical audience, especially decision-makers like heads of support\n- Is logical given the word count limits and explicitly specifies target word count for each section in [] brackets\n- Does not double up on sections/repeat the same information\n- Strategically incorporates the target SEO keywords in headings (H1, H2, H3) and content\n- Concludes with actionable next steps and a clear call to action\n- You should not include FAQs yet\n- Make sure to add meta description (140-150 characters),  excerpt (140-150 characters), and tags (3-4 tags with comma as separator, and capitalize where needed)\n- MAKE SURE the PROS and CONS are mentioned as a paragraph, not a bullet point list.\n    - if it's a PRICING LISTICLE of products, make sure to mentioned it in a form of bullet points\n- Does **not** include FAQs. \n- Includes:\n  - Meta description (140–150 chars)  \n  - Excerpt (140–150 chars)  \n  - Tags (3–4 tags, comma-separated, capitalized where appropriate)\n\nYour output should be a cleanly formatted markdown outline only, not the full blog.\n",
