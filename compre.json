#### Company

Founded in 2008, Expensify is a financial services startup that provides an online expense management service for millions of customers around the world.

Expensify takes the hassle out of expense reporting for over three million users and their accounting departments all over the world. Matching this vision of simple, personalized accounting with communication channels with customers is critical to Expensify’s success.

### Challenge

When Expensify first started in 2008, the company did what lots of fast-growing startups do: it received sales and support questions via email. By 2014, Expensify’s user base had exploded to over two million users — and their support system was breaking. Users complained about slow response times, emails from lucrative leads and customers were getting buried under a large volume of inbound requests, and there was a wide gap between the number of visitors on Expensify’s marketing site and the number of leads signing up.

At first Jason Mills, Director of Sales and Success at Expensify, tried switching to a ticketing solution for the company’s support team while sticking with email for sales. But the result was almost worse: the combination created more silos between teams and further slowed response times.

“Our support team had to do a ton of detective work every time they came back to an email chain or support ticket, trying to anticipate what the next question would be,” Mills says.

Returning to the drawing board, Expensify realized it needed a scalable way to return to the basics of personalized communication:

- **Exhibit a deep understanding of its customer base**, such as if customers were on a path to converting or if they were established customers.

- **Make communicating with Expensify hassle-free**, reflecting the company’s product brand of hassle-free expense reporting.

- **Create sophisticated prioritization of inbound requests** to ensure fast response and resolution times.


### Solution

Expensify initially installed Intercom [Inbox](https://www.intercom.com/suite/helpdesk/inbox), directing inbound support requests to a team inbox shared by 18 agents around the world. Every time a customer inquiry appears, an agent can see live user profiles next to the request, which paints a rich picture of who they’re talking to:

![](https://images.ctfassets.net/xny2w179f4ki/2TXGJ8lq95CKHJbww80BW5/8a4fe31a75e31cd9e50b89848dbe49c7/1.png?&q=90)

“Through Intercom we can tell if the person is an admin for a large paying customer, a free user, a user who’s about to convert, etc.,” says Mills. \"Intercom knows everything about our users, which helps our team all get on the same page faster.\"

Pairing support queries with user data empowers success agents to go beyond simply answering the question at hand. For example, if a success agent sees that a customer could benefit from a new release, he or she can proactively recommend it during a support exchange.

To encourage even more collaboration between teams, Expensify recently moved its sales team to Intercom by turning on Intercom’s live chat solution, on a few pages on the Expensify website. Expensify watched requests trickle in before excitedly making it available across the entire website. Looking back, Mills says, Expensify should have been less conservative about rolling it out.

“Intercom reduces the usual barriers for us to capture leads. If your initial interaction with a company is a cool website with friendly language, and then you have to fill out a big form to get any questions answered, that’s not a great experience.”

Faster response and a better customer experience

Since migrating to Intercom, Expensify has brought down response time to customers and leads to roughly 30 minutes, less than half the previous time, while managing even more conversations a month.

In addition, the team at Expensify is developing more positive working relationships with customers. “Intercom is really changing the tone of our conversations,” Barrett says. “A conversation, by default, is much more casual than email, which can prevent tempers from flaring as we work out their support issue. Often the angry emails we received happened because people felt like they had to overcompensate and fill a whole page with capital letters.”

“Intercom has changed the way our sales and support teams collaborate. It’s costly to acquire a single customer, so having a single tool that lets us track, coach and support users through every step of the funnel is priceless.”

The Intercom API is a versioned API. The version number increments by `0.1` each release, unless we introduce major new functionality, in which case we will increment by `1`. We do not follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Any breaking changes will be released in a new API version. Breaking changes are changes that can potentially break an integration. Breaking changes can include:

- removing an entire operation
- removing or renaming a parameter
- removing or renaming a response field
- adding a new required parameter
- making a previously optional parameter required
- changing the type of a parameter or response field
- removing enum values
- adding a new validation rule to an existing parameter
- changing authentication or authorization requirements

  <content># Answer Bot

**Note:** Zendesk has renamed our bot capabilities. Answer Bot is now AI agents. Article Recommendations are now autoreplies.

The Answer Bot Article Recommendations API provides Help Center article recommendations for an enquiry. Answer Bot uses machine learning to return articles that might potentially help solve the issue. To learn more, see [Answer Bot](https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/) on the Zendesk website.

To use the Answer Bot Recommendations API, your organization must have any Guide plan or Enterprise plan and have an Answer Bot monthly subscription. API usage is billed by request volume, with one resolution consumed for every 100 API requests. The API is also available on the trial.

### Run in Postman

If you use Postman, you can import the AnswerBot API endpoints as a collection into your Postman app, then try out different requests to learn how the API works. Click the following button to get started:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/19931619-fa010bae-22c3-4014-a36f-b7a9b37f6427?action=collection/fork&collection-url=entityId=19931619-fa010bae-22c3-4014-a36f-b7a9b37f6427&entityType=collection&workspaceId=cfe0e8e6-42d1-4f46-a048-90e2caae5a05)

If you don't use Postman, you can sign up for a free account on the [Postman website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app. For more information about using Postman with Zendesk APIs, see [Exploring Zendesk APIs with Postman](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/api-basics/working-with-the-zendesk-apis/exploring-zendesk-apis-with-postman/).

## [using answer bot article recommendations permalink](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/\\#using-answer-bot-article-recommendations) Using Answer Bot article recommendations

Requesting an [article recommendation](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_recommendations/#get-article-recommendations) from Answer Bot creates a _recommendation_. A recommendation is a collection of articles with content that might be related to the enquiry. The response also contains metadata that allows further access to Answer Bot API actions, such as resolving the request or providing feedback on the suggestion. See [Get Articles Recommendations](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_recommendations/#get-article-recommendations).

You can then use the recommended articles to provide a UI to your end users that allows them to self-solve their issue. If the user finds an answer to their question, you can use the API to mark the enquiry as resolved. You can also let the end user self-resolve an enquiry in Help Center. See [Resolve Enquiry in Help Center](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_feedback/#resolve-enquiry).

You can provide other feedback with the following API endpoints:

- [Record Article Viewed](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_feedback/#record-article-viewed)
- [Record Article Rejection](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_feedback/#record-article-rejection)

## [authentication permalink](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/\\#authentication) Authentication

Authentication works as described in [Security and authentication](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/security-and-auth/) in the general API introduction.

Only the [Get Article Recommendations](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_recommendations/#get-article-recommendations) requires authentication. Other endpoints require an interaction access token. The next section explains this type of token.

## [interaction access tokens permalink](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/\\#interaction-access-tokens) Interaction Access Tokens

The response from the API includes an `interaction_access_token` that is required for further actions in the API. The token uses the [JWT](https://jwt.io/) standard and contains encoded and signed internal information.

```
{  \"interaction_access_token\": \"GciOiJIUzI1NiJ9eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhb.0aWNsZXMiO...\",  ...}
```

The decoded JWT token contains the following information:

```
{  \"id\": 65731,  \"account_id\": 1682103,  \"brand_id\": 626052,  \"article_ids\": [],  \"exp\": 1525410034}
```

You can read more about [the JWT standard and decoding the token](https://jwt.io/) on the JWT IO website if you're debugging the integration.

Don't confuse the `interaction_access_token` with the `auth_token` in the same response. The `auth_token` is used in article URLs for resolving enquiries in Help Center. See [Resolve Enquiry in Help Center](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/answer-bot/answer-bot-api/article_feedback/#resolve-enquiry).</content>

## Enabling and disabling Answer Bot

Enabling and disabling Answer Bot is simply a matter of toggling it on or off in Zendesk Support.

**To enable Answer Bot**

1. Click the **Admin** icon (![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/manage_icon.png)) in the sidebar, then select **Business Rules > Answer Bot**.
2. Click the **Try Answer Bot for 30 days** to activate your 30-day unlimited trial.

![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/ab_trial.png)

When the Answer Bot page opens, follow the onboarding tool tips, along with the information in this article, to get Answer Bot up and running.


If you'd like to disable Answer Bot, you have to disable it for both email and the web form.

**To disable Answer Bot emails**

1. Click the **Admin** icon (![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/manage_icon.png)) in the sidebar, then select **Business Rules > Answer Bot**.
2. Click the **Email** tab.
3. For each trigger listed in the Answer Bot triggers section, click **Edit** to open that trigger's admin page.
4. Now, you can:



- **Deactivate** the trigger by clicking the Options menu icon (![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/macros_edit_menu_icon.png)) and selecting **Deactivate**
OR

- **Edit** the trigger to remove any Answer Bot-related actions. See [Editing and cloning triggers](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015611687#topic_dwq_zoy_tb) for more information.

**To disable the Answer Bot web form option**

1. Click the **Admin** icon (![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/manage_icon.png)) in the sidebar, then select **Business Rules > Answer Bot**.
2. Click the **Web form** tab.
3. Toggle off **Web form channel enabled** to disable.

![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/answerbot_webform_toggle.png)


Note: Note: If you currently are on a trial for Answer Bot, once your trial is done and you don't subscribe to Answer Bot, the feature will be deactivated automatically.

## Creating new triggers for Answer Bot

If you're creating a new trigger, make sure you're familiar with the process. See [Creating and managing triggers](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662106) for information.

**To create a trigger that includes Answer Bot**

1. Click the **Admin** icon (![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/manage_icon.png)) in the sidebar, then select **Business Rules > Triggers**.
2. Click **Add trigger**.
3. Create the trigger conditions. For example, you may want to have Answer Bot send an email with suggested articles to an end-user as soon as they submit a help request, but only from a mobile device. That trigger would include the following conditions:
   - Ticket \\| Is \\| Created

     AND

   - Requester: Role \\| Is \\| (end-user)

     AND

   - Ticket: Status \\| Is \\| New

     AND

   - Ticket: Channel \\| Is \\| Mobile
4. Next, configure the trigger to perform the following action:
   - Notifications: Answer Bot \\| (requester)

     This establishes that all tickets that meet the above conditions will send your Answer Bot email (see below) to the ticket requester.
5. When you select Answer Bot from the Actions drop-down, the Answer Bot email field appears:

![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/answer_bot_email_field.png)

6. Fill out the subject and body text you want to include in the Answer Bot email. Use the following placeholders to customize the email text. You can also click **View available placeholders** to view and copy placeholder text:

   - **{{answer\\_bot.article\\_list}}**
     **Required**. You must include this placeholder for the feature to work. This placeholder adds a list of up to three articles that best match the request, links to those articles, and inserts buttons the end-user can use to choose which article solved the request.

   - **{{answer\\_bot.first\\_article\\_body}}**
     **Optional**. This placeholder renders the first matching article (full HTML) into the email body, allowing end-users to read the article and solve their problem without needing to leave the email experience.

   - **{{answer\\_bot.article\\_count}}**
     **Optional**. This placeholder allows you to create an optional condition to send different body copy to customers based on how many articles are returned, for example:


     ```
     {% if answer_bot.article_count > 0 %}
         Here are some great articles that may help:
         {{answer_bot.article_list}}
         {{answer_bot.first_article_body}}
     {% endif %}
     ```


     Note: Answer Bot is not compatible with the `{{header}}` placeholder, which is an unsupported and deprecated placeholder that some customers may still be using in their HTML Email Template. The HTML Email Template can be found here: **Admin > Channels > Email > Email Templates > HTML template**

     While this placeholder currently functions with standard email notifications, it produces a malformed header in Answer Bot Notifications. To resolve the issue, remove this `{{header}}` placeholder from the Zendesk HTML Email Template. To replicate the look and feel of this placeholder, you can add the following code (with appropriate styling added as desired) to the Email Body section of your account's Notify Requester triggers.


     ```
      <a href=\"{{ticket.link}}\">Ticket #{{ticket.id}}: {{ticket.title}}</a>
     ```
7. In the section **Configure article labels and test Answer Bot**, click **Configure and test** to filter the list of offered Help Center articles based on labels:

![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/answer_bot_add_labels.png)



- **List of article labels to be included by Answer Bot for this trigger**: Enter labels you want to use to filter the articles. As you type into the tag field, autocomplete displays available labels beginning with the same word or characters. Any articles with any of these labels will be used as potential Answer Bot articles.
- **Ticket brand**: Use the drop-down to select a brand to run the test on. The brand selected here is purely for testing purposes, and will not be added to the trigger you are creating.
- **Ticket subject**: This field is used to test the articles returned when a ticket is filed with this subject.
- **Ticket description**: Enter a short description of seven or more words, written from the ticket submitter's perspective.

8. Click **Show suggested answers** for a list of articles the user may receive if these labels are applied when submitting a similar ticket. If you approve, click **Apply labels**; if you don't, edit the entries and try again, or click **Cancel**.
9. Click **Submit**.

The new trigger appears in the list on the triggers page, as well as on the Answer Bot admin page.

## Converting an existing trigger for Answer Bot

If you're editing triggers, make sure you're familiar with the process. See [Creating and managing triggers](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203662106) for information.

**To convert an existing trigger for Answer Bot**

1. Click the **Admin** icon (![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/manage_icon.png)) in the sidebar, then select **Business Rules > Answer Bot**.
2. Find the trigger you'd like to convert from the **Recommended triggers** list. . If your trigger is not listed there, it likely doesn’t meet the essential conditions needed for Answer Bot triggers.

![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/ab_recommended_triggers.png)

3. When you've found the trigger you want to convert, click the **Edit** button. The trigger's edit page opens.
4. In the triggers Actions section, click the **Convert to Answer Bot** button.

![](https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/ab_update_trigger_actions.png)

This updates the trigger, including adding the Answer Bot placeholders into the email body.

5. Edit the email as needed, and click **Save**. The trigger now includes Answer Bot functionality.

## Testing Answer Bot

You can test Answer Bot results for existing tickets, as described in the procedure [Creating nw triggers for Answer Bot](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004477627#topic_z4s_s52_gz). Simply open the trigger's edit page, and click the **Configure and test** button.

## [link  to overview](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#overview) Overview

Fin's Custom Helpdesk integration lets you bring the power of Fin to your in house helpdesk system. In this system you give Fin access by providing endpoints for Fin to read and write conversation data.

The integration uses a **pull-based architecture** where:

- **Fin pulls data** from your endpoints when needed
- **Fin pushes** answers back to your system
- **You notify Fin** of changes via webhooks

## [link  to core-objects](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#core-objects) Core Objects

The integration revolves around four core data objects:

1. **Conversation** \\- At it’s core, Fin works on conversations between an organization and an end-user. In our system, a conversation has a single end-user.
2. **Message** \\- An individual message within a conversation. A conversation is made up of many messages, and a message may be from an end-user, or an agent. For the purposes of the custom help center integration, we treat Fin itself as an agent.
3. **End User** \\- The end user a conversation is with – your customer.
4. **Agent** \\- An employee within your helpdesk system who may respond to conversations.

![image_preview](https://developers.intercom.com/assets/custom-helpdesk-object-model.bb5d10af968820a0f3710c51ac976f7596ab0c7a83112b4c6fec6b72d88d7637.71a4f21c.png)

## [link  to api-endpoints](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#api-endpoints) API Endpoints

In this API design, Fin pulls the data from your system when it needs it. You may notify Fin that the conversation has changed on their side by sending a webhook to the new hooks `/custom_helpdesk_conversation_event` with the ID of the conversation that has changed.Debouncing, locking, and data consistency concerns are handled within the Fin system itself.

The API endpoints are provided by you via the Deployment UI and specify exactly which URLs Fin should hit. Authorization tokens and webhook signing secrets would also be configured at this point.

This diagram shows a simplified version of the API calls made during synchronization. The “Custom Helpdesk Fin API Wrapper” represents the custom endpoints you would build to implement the integration specification. “Bespoke” here intends to represent that bespoke work that needs to be done in the external system for each request.

![image_preview](https://developers.intercom.com/assets/custom-helpdesk-sequence.6bba9a01f0c15d9a320917dfd92cea93b7c0f7722d492842190e98b1732109f8.71a4f21c.png)

The API endpoints are how Fin interacts with the four core data models mentioned previously. The internal logic of these endpoints is entirely up to you to implement. When a conversation is synchronized into Fin, it can then perform tasks, answer questions, etc – the entire Fin product is available.

> Note that conversation / user state is updated on each inbound / outbound event. For example, if the end user sends a message through the Fin Messenger or their user data is updated through a Workflow, we will synchronize data between our system and the external system. Similarly, if we receive a webhook from the external system, we will synchronize data between the two systems. This includes things like messages in the conversation, conversation state, user attributes, etc.

## [link  to general-flow](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#general-flow) General Flow

### [link  to fin-responses](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#fin-responses) Fin responses

We will call the `create_conversation` and `create_message` endpoints to send Fin's responses to your helpdesk. The `get_agents` endpoint is used only on initial setup of the integration to allow you to select the agent in _your system_ that represents Fin. In other words, after creating an agent profile for Fin in your helpdesk, you can select the same agent on Fin setup to represent Fin in `create_message` calls.

### [link  to handover-to-human-agent](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#handover-to-human-agent) Handover to human agent

If Fin is unable to answer an end user's question, we will attempt to handover the conversation to your helpdesk for a human agent to pick up. This involves calling your \"Update Conversation\" endpoint with a null `assignee_id` to indicate that Fin is no longer involved in the conversation.

### [link  to error-handling](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#error-handling) Error handling

We currently retry failed synchronizations with a backoff. We try this 3 times.

## [link  to guides-and-references](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#guides-and-references) Guides and References

### [link  to authentication](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#authentication) Authentication

To ensure secure communication, we support [two-legged OAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) for outbound requests to your API and webhook signature verification for inbound requests to Fin.

See [Authentication](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk/authentication) for more information.

### [link  to api-and-webhooks-reference](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk\\#api-and-webhooks-reference) API and Webhooks reference

Our [API and Webhooks reference](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/guides/fin-custom-helpdesk/api-posts-only) provides complete information on expected request / response formats to integrate with Fin.

> Note that the names of the endpoints are set by the custom helpdesk's API. They do not need to conform to the names given in our API spec (e.g. create\\_message).

### Content targeting

Fin can [target content](https://fin.ai/help/en/articles/10903029-manage-content-audiences-and-targeting-for-ai-answers) to customers based on their plan, location, brand, and more.

### Tone of voice

Customize [Fin's personality](https://fin.ai/help/en/articles/10752118-customize-fin-ai-agent-s-personality) by choosing a tone of voice like professional, friendly, humorous, and more. Then select how long Fin’s answers are, from shorter and concise, to longer and more thorough.

Please discuss access with your Account Manager.

Fin AI Agent usage is measured in ‘resolutions.’ This ensures that you only pay when Fin achieves the outcome you and your customers care about most – resolved conversations. A resolution is counted when either the customer confirms the AI Answer resolved their issue, or the customer doesn’t request more help after the last AI Answer.

How is ‘Messages Sent’ calculated?

‘Messages Sent’ is the metric that Intercom uses to calculate charges for certain message types within the Proactive Support Plus add-on. These message types are: Product Tours, Surveys, In-app Posts, Mobile Push, and Mobile Carousels.

‘Messages Sent’ is calculated by totaling all messages sent through Product Tours, Surveys, In-app Posts, Mobile Push, and Mobile Carousels. during a billing month.

The baseline monthly fee for ‘Proactive Support Plus’ includes 500 Messages Sent every month. Usage above this amount will be charged per unit (see additional usage question above).

For example: If you send 1000 Product Tours, 1000 Surveys, and 2000 Mobile Push messages during a billing month, your ‘Messages Sent’ total for that billing month would be 4000. Since the first 500 ‘Messages Sent’ are included each billing month, they are free. Only the additional 3500 Messages Sent’ would be billed as an additional charge.

Return on investment

## Maximize your ROI

You’ll save time and money with Zendesk. But don’t take it from us; take it from Forrester. Their Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study showed 301% return on investment over three years.

[Read the full study](https://www.zendesk.com/campaigns/total-economic-impact-of-zendesk/?utm_source=footer&utm_medium=webpromo&utm_campaign=Forrester-TEI-2025-Homepage_WW_2025Q3)

- ### Improve time to value



Zendesk works out of the box. Solve customer problems right away, rather than configuring complex software.

- ### Reduce effort per ticket



Self-service and automation deflect up to 25% of agent contacts. Resolve remaining tickets faster with rich customer insights.

- ### Keep costs low



You don’t need a developer army to start using Zendesk, or an influx of agents to keep using it. Efficiency and automation are baked in.

Phase 1

Refine the query

In order to optimize the accuracy of an answer that an LLM generates, the inputs the LLM receives must be refined for comprehension. The clearer and more understandable the query, the better the output.

Often in customer service, customers can write in to support without fully explaining or
contextualizing their query. To solve this problem, the Fin AI Engine™ has been
designed to refine the inputs that are sent to the LLM. This ensures that each customer
message is optimized in terms of its meaning and context so that the LLM has the best
possible chance of producing an accurate answer. In addition, the Fin AI Engine™
performs checks to see whether a Workflows automation or Custom Answer should be triggered
based on the topic and context of a customer's query, as well as performing safety checks
to filter out any questions that Fin shouldn't answer.

- 1.1Check for safety and relevance



AThe AI engine performs a comprehensive check of a customer query in order to filter for any questions that Fin shouldn't answer, such as requests for confidential information, irrelevant questions, malicious actors, data harvesting, and more.

- 1.2Optimize query comprehension



AThe AI engine optimizes the customer message to make it more searchable and easy to understand for the LLM. The AI engine performs many checks, and executes the correct optimization based on whether the query intent and topic is clear, if the query needs to be reworded, and much more.

- 1.3Check for Workflows automation



AThe customer's message is checked for the presence of any pre-configured conditions which trigger a specific automation (such as a complaint).

- 1.4Check for Custom Answer



AAn additional check is performed to detect whether a pre-configured Custom Answer is needed for the customer query.


Phase 2

Retrieve relevant content

The Fin AI Engine™ retrieval process, powered by our proprietary custom fin-cx-retrieval model, searches across all available knowledge sources (help center articles, resolved conversations, structured snippets, integrated systems etc) and selects the most relevant information to be used to answer accurately.

Once the query has been refined, the Fin AI Engine™ uses our proprietary custom fin-cx-retrieval model to ensure the LLM has the right context to answer accurately. It interprets the customer’s true intent, then searches across all available sources, including help center articles, snippets, uploaded documents, and integrated systems. Using semantic search, it finds conceptually relevant information even when different terms are used, and selects a small set of high-quality content to guide the LLM’s response.

- 2.1Understand intent behind the question



AThe fin-cx-retrieval model analyzes the customer's refined query to identify the true intent and purpose behind their request, going beyond surface-level keywords to understand what the customer actually needs to accomplish.

- 2.2Search across all available content sources



AThe fin-cx-retrieval model simultaneously searches through all configured knowledge sources—help center articles, conversation history, uploaded documents, and integrated systems to identify potentially relevant information.

- 2.3Match on semantics, not just keywords



AUsing advanced semantic understanding, the system identifies content that conceptually relates to the customer's question, finding relevant information even when different terminology is used between the query and source material.


Phase 3

Rerank for precision

The Fin AI Engine™ reranking process, powered by our proprietary custom fin-cx-reranker model, takes the retrieved content and scores each piece for relevance, accuracy, and usefulness in context. It then selects the final piece(s) for the LLM to use.

Not all retrieved content is equally valuable for answering a customer's specific question. The fin-cx-reranker model goes beyond simple keyword matching to intelligently evaluate and prioritize content based on how well each piece addresses the customer's unique situation and requirements. The system automatically deprioritizes outdated or low-confidence sources while prioritizing contextually appropriate solutions, ensuring customers receive current, reliable information that enables truly actionable responses.

- 3.1Score relevance with respect to query



AThe fin-cx-reranker model evaluates each content piece against the customer's specific query, scoring how directly and completely each source addresses the question's intent and requirements.

- 3.2Evaluate context match and resolution fit



AThe system assesses how well each content piece fits the customer's situation and context, prioritizing sources that provide actionable solutions rather than just related information.

- 3.3Downrank outdated or low-confidence sources



ASources are automatically deprioritized based on age, accuracy signals, and confidence metrics to ensure only the most reliable and current information is selected for answer generation.

- 3.4Output: final selected content for generation



AThe highest-scoring, most relevant content pieces are selected and optimally structured to provide the LLM with the best possible foundation for generating accurate, helpful responses.


Phase 4

Generate a response

Once a query has been checked and optimized, the next stage is to generate a response using the LLM. For this task, the Fin AI Engine™ uses a bespoke and enhanced generative process, hand-engineered and tested at scale to generate answers with the highest chance of resolving customer questions. At this point, any custom Guidance provided by the user to control the generated answer is also applied. This is the final step of our Retrieval Augmented Generation system (RAG for short).

The generation stage combines all refined queries, retrieved content, and reranked information to produce customer-facing responses. Unlike generic language models, our system is engineered specifically for customer service and intelligently chooses between generating a direct answer, asking for clarification, or taking concrete action based on confidence levels.

This process integrates our Guidance feature, allowing teams to embed their brand voice, policies, and escalation procedures directly into response generation. The result is responses that mirror your best human agents, ensuring every interaction aligns with company standards while maximizing resolution effectiveness.

- 4.1Integrate and augment



ARetrieved information is integrated with the optimized query to ensure the generative model has access to the most relevant and current information. The input is structured to maintain context and relevance, making it easier for the model to understand and use effectively.

- 4.2Interpret and apply Guidance



AThe Fin AI Engine™ applies any custom Guidance configured by your team to control tone, behavior, and response style. This ensures Fin generates answers that align with your brand voice and support policies, just like your best agents.

- 4.3Generate response



A
The system produces the final response through three possible paths:Clarify and disambiguate

If the model's confidence doesn't meet the Fin AI Engine™'s certainty parameters, it generates a clarification request to gather more information from the customer.






B
Take an action

When the query requires an action on external systems, Fin performs the necessary steps using the available data, integrations, and configured workflows.






C
Generate an answer

The model creates an accurate, contextually relevant response using all retrieved information and applied Guidance, with post-processing to ensure clarity and alignment with the customer's needs.


Phase 5

Validate accuracy

In the final step of the process, the Fin AI Engine™ performs checks to understand whether the output from the LLM meets the necessary response accuracy and safety standards. Many checks are performed, covering whether there is enough confidence in the response, the response is accurate enough, and whether the response is grounded enough in reality to address the question adequately.

- 5.1Validate the response



ACompare the generated response to the original customer query.



BDetermine if the generated response answers the query well enough.



CDetermine if the generated response is grounded in your knowledge content as a source of truth.

- 5.2Respond to customer



ASend the generated response back to the customer through Fin.


always-on

Engine optimization

To calibrate and enhance engine performance, the Fin AI Engine™ has advanced integrated tools that help optimize answer generation, efficiency, precision, and coverage.

- 6.1Fin customization and control



AIntercom has incorporated features and tools designed to help users customize and control how Fin responds, what it can do, what information it can use and much more. Each of these pieces plays a part in how well Fin performs. The more it knows how to do, the more it can do, and the more you will be able to automate your support with human-quality customer experiences.

- 6.2AI analytics and reporting



AThe Fin AI Engine™ has been designed to facilitate analysis on the effectiveness of each stage of the answer generation process. This gives the AI group at Intercom the tools they need to improve each stage of the process and overall performance. A rigorous amount of testing happens before any changes are made to the AI engine architecture, which takes into account how each small change impacts the engine as a whole. In addition, the AI engine offers Intercom users access to pre-built and customizable reports that help understand where Fin is working well, and what can be improved.

- 6.3AI recommendations



ATo improve performance over time, the AI engine will offer recommendations for which new content could help fill gaps in Fin's knowledge, what current content isn't performing very well and how it can be further optimized, and what actions Fin should be able to do in order to resolve more queries on behalf of the customer.

AI Trust & Security

Relying exclusively on the generative capabilities of an LLM to answer or solve a customer problem is not a reliable way to serve customers. Without the proper safeguards in place, LLMs can be open to manipulation or hallucinations, which could then impact your customers. To ensure safety and reliability, Intercom’s AI Engine™ has been designed with strict safety controls at each stage. If the necessary parameters for safety have not been met at any of the stages, Fin will let the customer know that it cannot answer the query and escalate to human support.

Intercom has implemented state-of-the-art security measures to protect Fin against a wide range of LLM threats, including those identified by the OWASP LLM Top 10. By consistently testing a variety of high-end LLMs, and deploying rigorous internal controls, security protocols, and safeguards, Fin is able to achieve the highest level of security and reliability while avoiding potential limitations and threats

That means you and your customers can always trust Fin’s answers as the safest, most accurate, and reliable of any AI Agent. Learn more about Fin’s safety measures on [trust.intercom.com](http://trust.intercom.com/).

**AI customer service software** has been gaining significant traction among businesses lately. This is in part due to its highly practical ability to provide quick and tailored solutions to customer queries.

According to our report, [_The State of AI in Customer Service_](https://www.intercom.com/resources/books/state-of-ai-in-customer-service-2023), **7 out of 10 support leaders** believe customers will expect AI-assisted service in the next five years, and that offering it could provide a decisive competitive advantage for companies.¹

In a world where customers demand unprecedented levels of fast, efficient service, AI software for customer service can help businesses deliver on those giant expectations. Not only can it improve a team’s overall efficiency, but it can also enable support reps to collaborate more effectively, thus facilitating faster, more efficient problem resolution.

In this article, we’ll explore:

- How is AI software used for customer service?

- What are the main benefits of this type of system?

- What is the best AI software for customer service?

- How do you get your team onboard with this new technology?

- 4 steps to start implementing AI customer service software


## **What is AI software for customer service?**

AI customer service software harnesses the capabilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer comprehensive support throughout the entire customer journey. This includes AI-enhanced iterations of chatbots, help desk solutions, ticketing systems, and knowledge bases.

This type of software can be integrated into various communication channels, including email, chat, and social media, to provide real-time support to customers. With the help of AI, businesses can automate repetitive tasks, quickly resolve customer queries, adjust the tone of messages with precision, and expand concise bullet points into comprehensive and detailed responses.

## **How is AI software used for customer service?**

### **1\\. Quickly resolve simple queries**

When it comes to [customer service](https://www.intercom.com/blog/what-is-customer-service/), resolving queries quickly and accurately is a critical capability. By leveraging an AI chatbot, queries are promptly addressed, drawing on information sourced from your learning center to offer accurate and timely responses.

When confronted with more complex, multifaceted queries, AI chatbots even have the capacity to pose probing questions and gather additional context. Should the AI bot still find itself unable to provide a sufficient answer or achieve resolution, it can rapidly transfer the query to a human support representative.

### **2\\. Summarize conversations**

Summarizing conversations is one of the many ways in which AI customer service software can be used. Support teams can use the software to generate an overview of a customer's entire conversation to date using just a few commands. This is particularly helpful when transferring tickets between representatives or stepping in for a sick or otherwise unavailable colleague.

This functionality seamlessly integrates into a help desk's Inbox, and that integration is exemplified by its implementation in platforms like Intercom.

AI-powered summarizing saves time and helps new stakeholders quickly get up to speed without having to sift through long chat logs or time-consuming email threads. Using these summaries can help teams provide faster and more accurate resolutions to customer queries. The type of service, it practically goes without saying, all but inevitably leads to higher [customer satisfaction](https://www.intercom.com/blog/what-is-customer-satisfaction/).

### 3\\. **Tone adjustment**

It's common for support reps to use different tones of voice with each customer, depending on the industry they work in or the type of query they're answering. Editing text for tone can be tiring and time-consuming, though. Fortunately, our AI software for customer service makes this task more effortless than it’s ever been before.

Our software excels at tone adjustment, and our [Inbox](https://www.intercom.com/inbox?on_pageview_event=inbox_footer) composer allows you to make your responses friendlier or more formal – depending on the context and recipient – with a simple click. In this way, you’re helping to make sure that your messages always strike the appropriate tone and leave your customers feeling valued and heard.

Further, we’re also introducing an innovative feature that empowers AI to dynamically adapt the tone of voice to responsively align with the support representative's own conversational style, drawing insights from conversation history.

### 4\\. **Rephrasing text**

Though it’s easily overlooked, rephrasing text is an essential aspect of customer service. With the constant influx of queries arriving in the inbox, it can be a daunting task to find the right language and word choice to get your message across clearly. However, with AI-powered customer service software, the process of rephrasing text is significantly faster and easier.

Our platform allows you to press a button and instantly rephrase a message. This not only saves time but also guarantees that your messages are always clear, concise, and highly intentional.

Additionally, our AI software can analyze customer queries and provide automated responses that are tailored to the customer's specific needs.

### **5\\. Answer expansion**

Another one of the ways AI software is used for customer service is through answer expansion. With this feature, short notes or bullet points can be elaborated and turned into a more comprehensive, fully fleshed-out response.

### **6\\. Help center article generation**

One of the biggest challenges companies face when trying to build out a comprehensive help center is writing enough articles to cover a vast range of potential customer queries.

Fortunately, help center article generation is another useful feature offered by AI customer service software. It’s designed to be an asset to your customer service department, assisting companies in creating long-form support documentation that covers customers' most frequently asked questions.

Needless to say, this functionality can provide a major boost to your help center while simultaneously easing the load on reps tasked with producing articles.

Though the accuracy of AI article generation isn’t always perfect, this feature can be very beneficial in producing a first draft – often the hardest part for team members writing heaps of help desk articles.

The article generation feature is a recent addition to our platform, and we’re still learning how to best go about harnessing its full potential. We believe, however, that AI text completion will quickly become a must-have resource for most long-form content editors in the near future.

## **What are the main benefits of adopting AI software for customer service?**

### **1\\. Always-on support**

Always-on support is one of the main benefits of an AI software for customer service. Tools such as AI-powered chatbots can ensure that customers get assistance at any time of the day.

### **2\\. Better customer experiences**

_The State of AI in Customer Service_ revealed that **61% of support leaders** that use AI and automation have seen improvements to their customer experience over the past year.

One of the main benefits of AI software for customer service is its ability to provide more agile and assertive assistance to customers when they need it most, thus translating into superior experiences. If you take into consideration the fact that [**89% of support leaders**](https://www.intercom.com/resources/guides/customer-service-trends-2023) believe that personalization can be a key competitive differentiator, this type of system offers a tremendous amount of potential.²

### **3\\. Enhanced customer satisfaction**

Implementing AI customer service software can bring numerous benefits to businesses. According to our research, **58% of support leaders that use AI and automation have seen improvements to their CSAT scores**. This suggests that people are more satisfied with the level of service they receive when AI is used to handle their inquiries.³

Further, we found that **66% of support leaders** that use AI and automation are achieving their [key performance indicators](https://www.intercom.com/blog/how-to-keep-kpis-meaningful-for-your-customer-support-team/) (KPIs) and meeting their [service level agreements](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/sla-service-level-agreement) (SLAs) thanks to the technology.⁴

## **What is the best AI software for customer service?**

### **1\\. Intercom**

If you want to make your customers feel seen and heard, [**Intercom**](https://www.intercom.com/) is the way to go. It’s the only solution that combines an AI chatbot, help desk, and proactive support — allowing you to keep costs low, support teams happy, and customers consistently satisfied. Intercom’s AI-enhanced workspace and intuitive interface enable businesses to engage with customers in real-time, fostering meaningful interactions at scale.

Employing state-of-the-art AI language models, our bot [**Fin**](https://www.intercom.com/fin) effortlessly resolves customer problems by delivering secure, precise, and natural responses derived exclusively from your support content.

### **2\\. Zendesk**

Zendesk is a well-known customer service platform that aims to streamline service interactions within a unified interface. Through the utilization of AI, the software identifies and categorizes customer queries, directing them to the appropriate agent or department.

Zendesk also developed the Answer Bot, a machine learning service bot that provides instant, accurate answers sourced from knowledge bases, community forums, and other trustworthy resources.

### **3\\. Help Scout**

Help Scout emphasizes simplicity and collaboration, offering a shared inbox for efficient customer support. Their recently developed AI features are designed to provide faster replies. However, Help Scout can be disappointing for users who expect or need more advanced AI-powered tools.

### **4\\. HubSpot**

HubSpot integrates customer relationship management (CRM) with support tools, streamlining communication and automating tasks. Although it has interesting tools aimed at customer service, it especially stands out for focusing on the marketing and sales stages of the customer life cycle.

### **5\\. Freshdesk**

Freshdesk, with its user-friendly interface and automation features, is also a solid option in the AI customer service software market. It enables ticket categorization and prioritization, as well as query assignments and SLA management.

## **How do you bring your team along on the AI software for customer service journey?**

### **1\\. Encourage your team to try AI for themselves**

As you start the implementation process for AI software for customer service, it's important to make sure your team is prepared and even excited for the journey. Encouraging team members to try AI for themselves is a great way to get started. For example, you can set up bot flows or create help center content for AI-powered bots to leverage.

### **2\\. Have an upfront conversation with your reps**

Having an upfront conversation with your reps is a crucial step in bringing your team along and making sure everyone is on the same page. To start with, you should ask your reps how you can make them feel more confident and comfortable during this transformative change in your business. This will help you better understand their specific concerns and start developing strategies to address them proactively.

You can also ask them where they see opportunities to use AI and automation to improve their existing workflows. By sparking an open conversation, you can identify areas where AI can be most beneficial and involve your reps in the process of implementing the technology.

Finally, ask your team members how they want their career to grow – it can help you understand their aspirations and provide them with relevant training and development opportunities. In the _State of AI in Customer Service_, we surveyed support leaders and found that these were the new positions created by AI they anticipated the most:

- Chatbot developers (58%)

- Chatbot analytics (51%)

- Chatbot data collection (49%)

- Conversation designers (39%)

- Chatbot strategists (38%)


### 3\\. **Keep listening to your reps’ feedback to improve processes**

It’s always important to listen to your team’s concerns. Your customer support reps have a wealth of first-hand experience about what customers want, need, and expect, and because of this depth of knowledge their feedback is invaluable.

Listening to and, when appropriate, incorporating your team members’ feedback will help you create smoother, more productive AI-powered workflows. Equally important, it will make your reps feel integral to the entire implementation process. This collaborative approach will help your team embrace AI and feel confident in using it to deliver exceptional customer service.

## **4 steps to get started with AI software for customer service**

### 1\\. **Identify the business outcomes you are trying to achieve**

It’s important to define the specific objectives you hope to accomplish by implementing an AI customer service software. By doing so, you can ensure that everyone involved in the project is on the same page and working towards the same end goal.

### 2\\. **Think about your current tech stack and your integration needs**

In addition, it’s essential to map out your existing IT infrastructure and identify any potential roadblocks or compatibility issues that may arise during the launch process. That way you make sure that the new solution effortlessly incorporates itself into your current systems and workflows.

### 3\\. **Check out the software's viability**

It's crucial to prove the software as soon as possible. This involves conducting pilot tests and trials to determine the effectiveness of the system in real-world scenarios. This is the best way to identify any potential issues or bugs early on and make necessary adjustments before rolling out the solution to a wider audience.

### 4\\. **Carefully consider how to maintain the knowledge necessary for an AI solution**

Finally, it's important to carefully consider the development and the maintenance of the knowledge necessary for an AI solution. This includes developing a plan for ongoing training and support to ensure that employees are equipped with the necessary skills to effectively use the software over a long period of time. By doing this, you can maximize the ROI of your solution and guarantee that it continues to provide value over the long term.

Security

## Secure by design.   Trusted by enterprise.

[Read our data security practices](https://www.eesel.ai/privacy \"Read our data security practices\")

## Your data is never used for training

We and our subprocessors (e.g. OpenAI) never use your data to train AI models. It’s contractually guaranteed.

## Locked down, end-to-end

Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Only your bots can access it - never humans, never other customers.

## Privacy-first and compliant

We follow GDPR and CCPA programs and offer EU data residency so your data never leaves the region.

## Built for enterprise IT

Choose zero chat log retention, self-hosted setups, or custom controls to meet your internal security needs.

#### Frequently asked questions

Is AI for customer support only for large teams?

Not at all. Whether you handle 50 or 5,000 tickets a month, AI for customer support can make a difference. eesel AI helps smaller teams do more with less and gives larger teams the consistency and speed they need to scale smoothly.

How does AI for customer service know what to say?

eesel AI learns from your real replies, saved macros, help center articles, and documentation. It studies how your team talks and responds, then mirrors that tone to give customers helpful and on brand answers without sounding robotic.

Can AI for customer support fully handle tickets or just assist agents?

Both. You can use eesel AI to suggest replies for agents or let it fully respond to repetitive tickets on its own. You are always in control of what it handles, when it escalates, and how much it helps.

What channels can AI for customer service cover?

eesel AI works across email, live chat, help desk forms, and even your internal knowledge base. It can also respond from your website chat widget or assist agents directly in tools like Zendesk and Freshdesk.

Will AI for customer support confuse customers or go off script?

No. eesel AI only uses the content you approve like your help center, docs, and macros so answers stay accurate and on message. You can test responses safely before anything goes live.

Is AI for customer service safe for sensitive data?

Yes. eesel AI is built with enterprise level security. Your data stays encrypted and private and is never used to train outside models. You decide exactly what it can access and respond with.

We’ve made significant updates to CX Score making it **more transparent, more representative, and more actionable**.

**What's new:**

- **Expanded CX signals with transparent reasons:**

CX Score now evaluates more criteria, including user effort, agent answer quality, emotion, and product & policy feedback, and clearly shows the reasons behind each score.

- **Clearer CX summaries:**

Every scored conversation now includes a more detailed summary explaining what happened and why it received its rating.

​
- **Broader scoring coverage:**

Short or low-context conversations now receive ratings, giving you a fuller, more representative view of customer experience.

This update helps teams focus on what matters—seeing the real drivers behind customer experience and taking the right actions sooner.

Fin now speaks in a more conversational, natural tone across all channels, giving clearer and warmer responses. Fin is also more concise by default; answers and disambiguations are now 10% shorter on average.

Fin also sometimes asks follow-up questions instead of “Did that help?” to better understand what customers need.

These improvements have resulted in an increase in user-confirmed resolutions and end-user reported satisfaction.

These changes don’t impact Escalation Guidance behavior, and your general Guidance can still override this default behavior.

You can now control what teammates see with a new permission setting. By default, teammates only see the teams and inboxes they belong to - everything else appears as “Redacted.” This protects sensitive information while keeping cross-team workflows smooth.

**Key updates:**

- New permission: “Can view all teammate and team details” toggles between full and scoped visibility.
- Redaction applies consistently across Inbox, Conversation App, assignment pickers, and conversation history.
- Reporting automatically scopes data for restricted viewers, and disables external sharing.

Topic Curation gives teams control over how AI-generated topics in the analyze panel are organized and labeled—so Insights, Reports, and Suggestions reflect the language your business actually uses, without manual tagging or model retraining.

**What's new:**

- **Create new topics and subtopics**

Capture emerging themes the moment they appear, so similar conversations are grouped and analyzed automatically going forward.

- **Rename, move, and merge subtopics**

Align AI-generated labels to your team’s terminology and structure. This improves signal quality and makes trends easier to understand and act on.

- **Delete low-value or outdated subtopics**

Remove noise to keep Insights, Trending Topics, and Suggestions focused on the issues that matter most.

This update helps support teams focus on what matters—seeing the real drivers of volume, prioritizing fixes faster, and keeping reporting aligned to the business.

## Frequently asked questions, answered.

### How can I buy your software?

After clicking “Buy now”, you will create a Zendesk account and immediately be able to purchase your software. You can easily pay by credit card or Paypal. Customers who prefer to purchase through our sales representatives can opt to pay via invoice.

### What is the difference between Zendesk Suite and Zendesk Support plans?

The Zendesk Suite is your all-in-one, complete CX solution for the AI era. It comes fully equipped with ticketing, messaging including live chat capabilities, a robust help center for both internal and external use, and voice support. These plans are perfect for businesses providing support across multiple channels. All Zendesk Suite plans boost efficiency with cutting-edge automations and AI agents, available 24/7 to resolve customer issues swiftly and effectively. [Explore all Suite plans here](https://www.zendesk.com/pricing/).

Alternatively, if you’re just starting out and focusing on email customer support, building your own Support plan is a smart choice. This option gives you the flexibility to nail down the basics, with the opportunity to add more channels, enhance product capabilities, or upgrade to the full Zendesk suite as your needs evolve.

### What is Salesforce?

Salesforce is the [**#1 AI CRM**](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/worlds-number-one-crm/) (customer relationship management) platform. We bring companies and customers together by providing a unified set of applications — powered by [agentic AI](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-agentic-ai/) and data — that help every department, including sales, service, marketing, commerce, and IT, work as one. You can learn more about [what Salesforce is](https://www.salesforce.com/products/what-is-salesforce/) and [what Salesforce does](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-does-salesforce-do/) by visiting [our official resources](https://www.salesforce.com/company/our-story/). Our cloud-based agentic solutions help you find more leads, close more deals, and provide better service to your customers, all on a single, integrated agentic platform.

### What is CRM and why do I need one?

[**CRM**](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/) stands for **customer relationship management.** It’s a technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. A CRM system helps you:

**• Organize** contact information, leads, and customer service data

**• Automate** tasks like logging calls and sending follow-up emails **• Analyze** data to understand customer behavior and business performance

A CRM, especially one powered by AI like Salesforce, is essential for growth because it gives you a **single**, [**360-degree view** of every customer](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/), allowing you to build stronger, more profitable relationships at scale.

### What is agentic AI and how is it used in Salesforce?

[**Agentic AI**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/what-is-agentic-ai/) refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that can act [**autonomously**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/autonomous-agents/) to achieve a specific goal with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional [AI](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/) that only generates content or analyzes data, agentic AI can reason, plan multistep actions, and execute tasks.

In Salesforce, agentic AI — part of our [**Agentforce**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/) technology — is used to:

**• Automate** complex workflows like lead qualification or service case resolution

**• Predict** business outcomes, such as which deals are likely to close

**• Personalize** every customer interaction across marketing, sales, and service channels

### How does Salesforce CRM help my small business grow?

Salesforce offers agentic CRM solutions tailored for companies of all sizes, from [startups and small businesses](https://www.salesforce.com/small-business/) to large global enterprises. Our Agentforce 360 Platform is **flexible** and **scalable**, allowing you to start with the essentials you need — like sales, service, commerce, or marketing — and easily add more functionality as your business grows. This ensures you only pay for what you use and have an [AI and CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/ai-crm/) platform that can grow with your business.

Building on the momentum of the recently launched [Zendesk Resolution Platform](https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/articles/relate-2025-resolution-platform/), a complete AI-first solution that integrates automation, intelligence, and human context to resolve issues faster, Zendesk is advancing its vision for seamless, outcome-focused service with a powerful suite of new capabilities. By embedding breakthrough generative AI and advanced analytics, Zendesk continues to shape the future of customer and employee experience.

Zendesk’s platform uniquely prioritizes resolution as the key success metric, ensuring that interactions lead to real solutions. Unlike traditional services that measure volume through interactions or attempts, this approach reduces effort and drives better outcomes.

The newest capabilities advance Zendesk’s vision by delivering truly omnichannel and democratized AI capabilities.

“We’re accelerating our pace of innovation like never before, delivering new products and capabilities faster to meet our customers’ evolving needs,” said Shashi Upadhyay, Zendesk President of Product, Engineering and AI. “Our focus remains on building AI-powered solutions that are simple, easy-to-use, and scalable, ensuring businesses across all industries can seamlessly enhance their customer and employee experience without complexity or compromise.

### What is the difference between Zendesk Suite and Zendesk Support plans?

The Zendesk Suite is your all-in-one, complete CX solution for the AI era. It comes fully equipped with ticketing, messaging including live chat capabilities, a robust help center for both internal and external use, and voice support. These plans are perfect for businesses providing support across multiple channels. All Zendesk Suite plans boost efficiency with cutting-edge automations and AI agents, available 24/7 to resolve customer issues swiftly and effectively.

At Zendesk, these models help power AI agents, Copilot, Knowledge, QA features and more.

We run a rigorous benchmarking program to select the right model for each use case – considering latency, cost, and quality – while tuning prompts for optimal performance. New models are evaluated, tested, and deployed in under 24 hours. Every decision is documented and auditable, ensuring transparency and reliability as our AI capabilities evolve.

### Are there upfront costs or additional fees?

Salesforce has all kinds of add-ons, apps, and additional products to help your company stay ahead in your industry. Call us at 1-800-664-9073 to discuss exactly what kind of products you’re looking to add and how we can help.

### What if my business priorities and product needs have changed?

We know things don’t always go according to plan, and we’re here and will try our best to support. Reach out to a sales representative at 1-800-664-9073 to discuss options.

### Do Salesforce products integrate with outside applications and systems?

In many cases, Salesforce products integrate directly with many outside applications and systems to help you connect your data. For those that don’t have built-in integration, like on-premises data sources, you can purchase licenses of MuleSoft, work with our integration partners, or use apps on AppExchange. Talk to a sales representative to get an idea of what integration solution works best with the Salesforce products you use.

### What support and service packages are available?

We offer several advisory, adoption, and support plans to our customers. To learn more, visit [Success Plans](https://www.salesforce.com/services/success-plans/).

### How long are your contracts?

Most Salesforce products use annual contracts, but Salesforce subscription terms vary. Chat with a sales representative to discuss payment and billing options for your products.

### Can I upgrade at any time? Can I add more products later on?

You can add products or upgrade at any time, but some products may need to scale together. Reach out to our sales department at 1-800-664-9073 to see what works for your business.

\\\\* This edition requires an annual contract. This page is provided for informational purposes only and is subject to change. Contact a sales representative for detailed pricing information.
