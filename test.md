## H2: A full breakdown of MyAskAI pricing plans [~600 words]
- Briefly introduce the different AI pricing models to provide context: per-conversation, per-resolution, and capacity-based.

### H3: The MyAskAI pricing model explained
- State clearly that MyAskAI uses a **per-conversation pricing model**.
- Explain what this means: you are charged for every support ticket the AI engages with, regardless of whether it fully resolves the issue.
- **Crucially, detail the confusing definition of a \"conversation\" from their support docs**:
    - For helpdesk integrations (Zendesk, Intercom), a conversation is every 2.5 AI responses.
    - For email/tickets, the first AI reply is 1 conversation, and subsequent replies are 0.4 conversations.
- Highlight how this complexity can make costs hard to predict.

- **Price:** $149 per month, or about $99 per month with an annual commitment (33% discount).
- **Included Capacity:** 1,000 conversations per month.
- **Overage Cost:** $0.10 for every conversation over the 1,000 limit.
- **Core Features Table:** Use a markdown table to list the key features included in the Pro plan.

## H2: Key limitations of MyAskAI [~500 words]
- Frame this section as important considerations for teams before committing to the platform.

### H3: Unpredictable pricing that punishes growth
- Explain how the per-conversation model ties costs directly to ticket volume. As your business grows, your AI bill grows with it, which can undermine the cost savings.
- Contrast this with platforms like [eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/pricing), which offers predictable, capacity-based pricing. With a fixed monthly bill for a set number of interactions, you're never penalized for having a busy month.

### H3: Limited native integrations for enterprise knowledge
- Acknowledge their integrations with common tools like Google Drive and Notion.
- Point out that this may not be sufficient for businesses where knowledge is stored in more complex systems.
- Subtly mention that a tool like [eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/integrations/all) offers over 100 out-of-the-box integrations, including deeper connections with sources like Confluence and past support tickets, ensuring a more comprehensive knowledge base from day one.

### H3: Basic simulation and forecasting
- Mention that MyAskAI allows testing on historical tickets, which is a useful starting point.
- Explain the limitation: this basic test doesn't provide the hard data (like projected deflection rates or cost savings) needed for a confident, data-backed rollout.
- Highlight how [eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/) stands out with its robust simulation mode, which runs on thousands of past tickets to provide precise, data-backed forecasts on resolution rates and ROI before you go live.

## H2: A more predictable alternative: eesel AI [~400 words]
- Position eesel AI as a compelling alternative for teams seeking more control, predictability, and power.

### H3: Transparent pricing that stays flat
- Explain [eesel AI's pricing model](https://www.eesel.ai/pricing): a straightforward, capacity-based system where you pay a fixed monthly cost for a pool of \"AI interactions\" (one reply or one action).
- Mention specific plans like the **Team Plan** ($299/mo for 1,000 interactions) and **Business Plan** ($799/mo for 3,000 interactions) to emphasize predictability and transparency.
- **Image Placeholder:** Screenshot of the eesel AI pricing page, highlighting the capacity-based model.

### H3: A truly self-serve setup in minutes
- Emphasize that users can sign up, connect their helpdesk, train the AI, and go live entirely on their own, without mandatory demos or sales calls. This respects the user's time and empowers them to get started immediately.

### H3: Total control over your AI agent
- Briefly describe the power of eesel AI's workflow engine.
- Mention key control features: deciding exactly which tickets the AI handles, fine-tuning its personality with a prompt editor, and adding custom actions (like looking up Shopify orders or automatically tagging tickets).

## H2: The bottom line on MyAskAI pricing [~200 words]
- Summarize the main points: MyAskAI offers a functional AI agent with a simple, per-conversation pricing model that can be a decent entry point for some teams.
- Reiterate the limitations: the pricing can become expensive and unpredictable as you scale, and the platform lacks the deep integrations and robust forecasting tools needed by modern support teams.
- Conclude by positioning [eesel AI](https://eesel.ai/) as a more robust and scalable solution for teams that value a predictable budget, deep customization, and a data-backed deployment strategy.
