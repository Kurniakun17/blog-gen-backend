  Choosing the right AI customer support platform can feel like you're lost in a maze of buzzwords. Everyone claims to have an \"all-in-one\" solution, but what that actually means is anyone's guess. Two names you'll see everywhere are [Tidio and Landbot](https://www.g2.com/compare/landbot-vs-tidio). They're both popular, they're both powerful, and they often get tossed into the same bucket, but they were built with very different ideas in mind.

So, how are you supposed to pick one? This post is a straight-up, no-fluff comparison of Tidio vs Landbot. We'll get into their features, pricing, and who they’re actually for. We’ll also touch on a third option for teams that are perfectly happy with their current helpdesk and aren't keen on a massive, painful migration just to get some AI features.

## What is Tidio?

Think of [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/) as an all-in-one AI customer service platform aimed mostly at small to medium-sized businesses, especially e-commerce shops. Its main goal is to give you one spot to handle every customer conversation, no matter where it started.

It bundles a handful of tools into a single package: a [built-in help desk and ticketing system](https://www.tidio.com/help-desk/), live chat, and scripted automations they call \"Flows.\" The main attraction is their conversational AI agent, \"Lyro,\" which fields common questions. The idea is simple: instead of juggling five different apps, you just use Tidio. It's meant to be the command center for your entire support setup.

## What is Landbot?

At its heart, [Landbot](https://landbot.io/chatbot-for-website) is a no-code chatbot builder. It’s all about helping you create slick, interactive conversations for marketing, sales, and support.

Its biggest selling point is a really powerful, visual drag-and-drop builder. It lets you map out complex, branching conversations with all sorts of custom logic. If you need to build a detailed lead qualification funnel or a guided product finder, Landbot is a powerhouse. It’s less of a complete help desk and more of a specialized tool for crafting the conversational bits of the customer journey. It does have a \"Team Inbox\" for when a human needs to step in, but it’s not designed to be a full-blown ticketing system.

## Head-to-head feature comparison

Alright, let's get into the details. While Tidio and Landbot both offer \"chatbots,\" the way they handle automation, AI, and the agent experience is night and day.

### AI and automation capabilities

**Tidio:** Tidio’s AI is called Lyro, an [AI agent powered by Claude](https://www.tidio.com/ai-agent/) that learns from a knowledge base you build inside its platform. It can supposedly handle up to 67% of common questions, which is pretty good. For more basic, scripted tasks (like asking for an email), Tidio has a visual editor for building rule-based \"Flows.\"

**Landbot:** Landbot is known for its powerful, visual, rule-based flow builder—it’s the core of the product. On top of that, they offer native [AI Agent Chatbots](https://landbot.io/ai-agent-chatbots) that you can train on your own knowledge base. For teams that need a bit more muscle, you can connect it to third-party tools like Google's Dialogflow to manage more complex language.

**The catch:** You might notice a pattern here. Both platforms need you to put all your knowledge *into their systems*. You have to write articles, upload documents, and cross your fingers that you’ve covered everything. This is where a tool like [eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/) works completely differently. Instead of making you move all your data, it plugs right into your *existing* knowledge—your old helpdesk tickets, Google Docs, Confluence, you name it. This means you can [go live in minutes](https://docs.eesel.ai/), not weeks, because the AI learns from the work you've already put in.

### Help desk and ticketing system

**Tidio:** This is a clear win for Tidio. It comes with a complete, [built-in help desk with ticketing](https://www.tidio.com/help-desk/), routing, and a shared inbox that pulls in chats from all your channels. It’s built to be the single source of truth for your support team.

**Landbot:** Landbot doesn't have a real ticketing system. It has a \"Team Inbox\" for agents to take over conversations, but it's not made for managing a queue, tracking resolution times, or handling typical support workflows. You'd need a separate help desk for that.

**The challenge:** This puts you in a tough spot. With Tidio, you have to move your entire support operation to their help desk, ditching the tools your team already knows. With Landbot, you have to piece it together with another system, which can make for a clunky handoff. The [AI Agent from eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/product/ai-agent) gets around this by working *inside* your current helpdesk, whether that's Zendesk, Freshdesk, or Intercom. You get top-notch AI without having to tear everything down and start over.

### Supported channels and integrations

**Tidio:** Tidio gives you out-of-the-box support for most channels that small businesses use: website [live chat](https://www.tidio.com/live-chat/), email, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Everything gets funneled into their dashboard. They also have over [120+ integrations](https://www.tidio.com/integrations/) with other popular tools.

**Landbot:** Landbot is strongest on the web, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. If you want to connect it to other channels, you'll probably need their [API access](https://landbot.io/api-sdk), which is only on the more expensive plans. It does [integrate nicely](https://landbot.io/integrations) with CRMs and marketing tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zapier.

Here’s a quick rundown:

| Feature | Tidio | Landbot |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Focus** | All-in-one AI support suite | No-code conversational flow builder |
| **AI Engine** | Lyro (trained on internal KB, powered by Claude) | Native AI Agents + Dialogflow integration |
| **Built-in Help Desk** | Yes, with ticketing & routing | No, has a \"Team Inbox\" for handoffs |
| **Visual Builder** | Yes, for rule-based \"Flows\" | Yes, its core strength and focus |
| **Key Channels** | Web chat, Email, Social Media | Web, WhatsApp, Messenger, API |
| **Best For** | SMBs wanting a single support tool | Teams building complex chat funnels |



## Pricing and plans explained

Let's talk money. Both platforms use a tiered pricing model that can get a bit confusing, especially since they charge based on how much you use them. This means your bill can swing from month to month, which isn't ideal for budgeting.

### Tidio pricing

Tidio splits its pricing into a few different buckets on their [official pricing page](https://www.tidio.com/pricing/).

*   **Free plan:** Good for a test run. It gives you 50 live chat conversations per month.
*   **Standalone Products:** If you only want one piece of the platform, you can buy Lyro AI starting at $32.50/month for 50 AI-powered conversations, or their Flows builder starting at $24.17/month for up to 2,000 unique visitors.
*   **Bundled Plans:** This is where it gets a little more complicated.
    *   **Starter:** Kicks off at $24.17/month and includes 100 \"billable\" conversations (any chat a human joins).
    *   **Growth:** Starts at $49.17/month.
    *   **Plus:** Jumps to a hefty $749/month for more advanced stuff.

### Landbot pricing

Landbot’s tiers are a bit simpler, but the costs can add up fast, especially if you need WhatsApp. You can see all the details on their [pricing page](https://landbot.io/pricing).

*   **Sandbox:** A free plan with 100 chats/month so you can play with the builder.
*   **Starter:** €40/month (about $43) for 500 chats/month on web and Messenger.
*   **Pro:** €100/month (about $108) for 2,500 chats/month.
*   **Business:** Starts at €400/month.

**The hidden cost:** Here’s the big one. [WhatsApp support](https://landbot.io/whatsapp) is a separate, pricey add-on. The WhatsApp Pro plan, for instance, starts at an extra €200 per month. That can easily double or triple your bill if WhatsApp is a big deal for your business.

### The problem with paying per chat

The pay-as-you-go models from both Tidio (charging per \"billable conversation\") and Landbot (charging per chat) lead to unpredictable bills. If you have a busy month, your costs could shoot up without warning, making it tough to plan your budget.

This is a big difference from [eesel AI's predictable pricing](https://www.eesel.ai/pricing). We offer plans with a flat monthly fee that includes a generous number of AI interactions, providing financial stability so you can scale up without sweating surprise fees. For instance, the Team plan gives you up to 1,000 AI interactions for $239/month (billed annually). The chart below visualizes this key difference.

## The big question: Replace or enhance?

On the surface, both platforms have a decent list of integrations. You can connect them to Shopify, HubSpot, Zendesk, and other common tools.

But here’s the real issue: Tidio and Landbot are designed to *replace* your core systems. They want to be the hub where every conversation happens. This strategy forces you into a corner: either move all your data and retrain your team on a new help desk (Tidio), or juggle a disconnected workflow between your chatbot and your actual support system (Landbot). It’s the classic \"rip and replace\" method that’s expensive, risky, and a pain for everyone involved.

[eesel AI](https://www.eesel.ai/) is built on the opposite idea: *enhance*, don't replace. It’s an AI layer that plugs directly into the helpdesk and knowledge bases you already use. You can add a powerful, autonomous AI agent to your existing setup in a few minutes. There's no migration, no disruption, and no need to ditch the tools your team already likes.

## The verdict: When to choose Tidio, Landbot, or eesel AI

So, after all that, which one should you pick? It really depends on where your business is at and what you're trying to do.

*   **Go with Tidio if:** You're a small business that's just starting out. You don’t have a help desk yet and you want one affordable, all-in-one platform to handle customer chats, emails, and social media in one place.
*   **Pick Landbot if:** Your main goal is building clever, interactive chatbot funnels for marketing and lead generation. If you love visual builders and want to create complex conversational flows, especially on WhatsApp, [Landbot is for you](https://landbot.io/).
*   **Consider eesel AI if:** You already have a helpdesk like Zendesk, Freshdesk, or Intercom that your team knows inside and out. It’s the smart choice for established teams that want to add powerful AI automation to their existing tools without the headache of a full migration.

## Upgrade your support without replacing your tools

At the end of the day, Tidio is the all-in-one suite for SMBs, and Landbot is the specialist for complex conversational flows. Both are great tools, but they ask you to buy into their entire ecosystem.

But what if the question isn't \"which new platform should we move to?\" What if it's \"how can we make the platform we already have smarter?\"
