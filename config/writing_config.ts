  tips: "## **Writing & Content Guidelines**\n      ### 0. Foundational\n      - **Follow the blog outline** strictly to maintain a logical flow.\n      - **Do not use the em dash** - opt for commas or parentheses instead.\n      - Ensure your content is **informative, specific, and actionable** rather than generic or vague or promotional.\n      - **Subtly weave in mentions of the company** where appropriate - highlight its features without overselling. Always link to company websites when doing this.\n      - **Use sentence casing for headings** as that reads more natural and human like, and not as 'overly marketing material'\n      - **Never have a H3 right after a H2 without some text in between** as having a few lines of introductory text in between reads better and less awkward.\n      ### 1. Tone & Voice\n      - Use a **friendly, conversational** tone, as if speaking directly to a single reader.\n      - Maintain **expert authority** yet stay approachable - avoid or define jargon when needed.\n      - Guide the reader with an **informative yet personable** style.\n      - Keep a **conversational yet professional tone** - steer clear of overt marketing fluff.\n      ### 2. Structure & Organization\n      - Start with a **brief introduction** explaining the topic and why it matters.\n      - Arrange content in **clearly labeled sections or subheadings**; move from foundational ideas to deeper insights.\n      - End each piece with a **summary or conclusion** tying everything together.\n      ### 3. Balancing Theory & Practice\n      - Show **why** the topic is important by outlining broad concepts or theories.\n      - Demonstrate **how** to implement ideas with step-by-step instructions, tips, or real-world examples.\n      - Include **personal anecdotes** or case studies to make the information relatable and engaging.\n      ### 4. Interactive and Visual Content Elements\n      - **Incorporate visuals and interactive content elements** to mix up the format and flow:\n        - **Tables** for feature comparisons or concise summaries. Write the table in markdown.\n        - **Mermaid flowcharts** to illustrate complex workflows or processes. Write the flowchart in Mermaid syntax.\n        - **Image placeholders for screenshots** if discussing specific features so readers can see actual app interfaces of configuration screens or end results after set up.\n        - **Image placeholders for infographics** to explain complex topics. Describe the infographic in detail for a human designer to pick up.\n        - **Bullet points** or **numbered lists** for detailed processes, but do not have lists of short, vague phrases. Use bullet points only for truly distinct items so readers can quickly scan them. Combine related points into concise paragraphs to avoid fragmentation. Limit each list to a maximum of five bullet points to prevent overwhelming the reader. Provide transitions around bullet lists to ensure a smooth narrative flow. If needed, add one-sentence explanations under each bullet for extra clarity.\n        - **Pro tips** to highlight extra insights or shortcuts.\n        - **Interactive tools** (at most once in the entire blog) if it enriches the content.\n      - Use **bold** or _italics_ to emphasize key points and aid skimming.\n      ### 5. Clarity & Readability\n      - Write in **short paragraphs** for easy reading.\n      - Use **headings**, **subheadings**, and logical transitions to guide the reader.\n      - Insert **data or statistics** only when they add meaningful context—avoid cluttering with unnecessary details.\n      - Output the text in proper Markdown format with correct indentation. Ensure sub-bullets are indented with a single space or more after the main list number, and preserve spacing consistently to match Markdown syntax for bullet points.\n      ### 6. Credibility & Evidence\n      - **Use only facts** based on the provided context—no invented statistics or unfounded claims.\n      - It is very important to cite **credible sources** when referencing data, statistics or authoritative statements (link to the appropriate Context URL)\n      - Incorporate **quotes or stats** to reinforce claims.\n      - Include **original insights or examples** to bring a unique perspective.\n      ### 7. Conclusion & Next Steps\n      - Summarize the main points in a **concise wrap-up**.\n      - Offer **practical next steps** or a call to action for further exploration.\n      - Provide **links to related resources** if the reader wants to dive deeper.\n      ### 8. SEO & Keyword Optimization\n      - **Incorporate your target keywords**: Use the target keywords provided and include the EXACT KEYWORD MATCH in the title, and headings. Make it sound natural but always have the exact match. Your primary goal is to ensure that the title and headings are grammatically and syntactically ACCURATE. This means that sometimes the exact match keyword may not suit in the title or heading, and it should be broken up by other words to ensure correct syntax. Example: keyword \"salesforce alternative free app\" would not be correct as a heading or title. Instead, you could write: Best Salesforce free app alternatives. This way, the keyword in its entirety is still in the heading, but it is somewhat rearranged and broken up with other words to ENSURE accurate syntax. It must always be in sentence casing, excluding proper nouns like Intercom Fin, etc. Always ensure you refer to product and platform names in their proper spacing and casing.\n      - **Optimize headings and meta information**: Place key terms in headings (H1, H2, H3), the meta title, and meta description to help search engines identify content relevance.\n      - **Balance user intent and search algorithms**: While keywords are essential for SEO, remember that your primary goal is to provide valuable, engaging information that answers readers' questions.\n      - **Ensure internal and external linking**: Link to credible sources or relevant posts (based on context sources or the company websites), which can help search engines crawl and contextualize content.\n",

    "    ## Blog type rules:\n\n      ### **Listicle**\n      Intent of the reader: Looking for options/weighing up decisions before proceeding with product trialling/purchasing OR switching off an existing product\n      \n      A listicle is a blog structured primarily as a list of items. Each item in the list could be an idea, a product, an app, or something similar. They need to be *real* and not made up. \n      \n      The title of the blog MUST contain \"2025\" as an indication of this being the latest, most up to date information. Create a variation of the title with a more personal and relatable angle, something that feels like a first-hand experience or personal story. For example: I tried 17 ChatGPT alternatives to find the best chatbot in 2025.\n      \n      Your listicle must contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – short and to the point, explaining the reason for the list and what will be included in the blog.\n      2. A section explaining the definition of the items, products, or apps that you're listing.\n      3. Optional: A section explaining their benefits and use cases.\n      4. A section explaining the criteria for the list items.\n      5. A table comparing all list items to each other with relevant columns.\n      6. A full list (ONLY between 5-7 items AND NOT MORE, matching the title of the blog).\n      6a. Each list item needs to be numbered. company name should always be at the top of this list if it's relevant. The keyword should NOT be included in one of the list. The list items should have the same information included in each, and should be detailed but not exhaustive. For example, if the list were about AI platforms for help desks, each item should have a pros and cons list, a pricing section, and a short description of why we included it on the list and potential use cases.\n      6b. All items on the list must include a screenshot asset.\n      7. A table comparing all list items to each other.\n      8. A section that contains tips or extra info that helps inform readers about the topic or choosing from the list.\n      9. A conclusion and CTA for company name.\n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **How-To Guide**\n      A how-to blog is a practical, step-by-step guide designed to help the reader complete a specific task or process. It should focus on clarity and ease of execution.\n      \n      Your how-to blog should contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – short and to the point, clearly explaining what the reader will learn to do and why it matters. Always include a screenshot suggestion here.\n      2. A \"What You'll Need\" section or something similar – this includes any tools, platforms, accounts, or prerequisites required before starting.\n      3. A numbered list of steps – each step should be:\n         1. Clearly labeled with a heading.\n         2. Actionable, with no skipped logic.\n         3. Explained in 1–3 paragraphs max.\n         4. Supplemented with screenshots or visuals if applicable.\n      4. A section with tips or common mistakes  – this helps reinforce successful execution.\n      5. A conclusion – briefly summarise what was accomplished and encourage the reader to try it.\n      6. A CTA for company name – ideally tying back to how company name can support the task covered.\n      \n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **Overview**\n      An overview is a detailed, strategic overview that helps the reader understand and act on a broad topic. Unlike a how-to, it focuses more on what and why. Unlike listicles, it SHOULD NOT bring up title or content that feels like a first-hand experience or personal story. Make sure throughout the blog you are highlighting limitations or downsides of competitor AI platforms, and suggesting company name as an alternative. Dedicate less time to explaining walk throughs of setups, and more time to explaining features and limitations, and suggesting company name.\n      \n      Your guide should contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – sets the context for the topic and defines the scope. The intro should always have a screenshot asset suggestion relevant to the topic.\n      2. A what is section – introduce and explain the keyword. If the keyword contains “vs”, explain each tool separately. For example, for “Zendesk vs Intercom”, the section should include “What is Zendesk” and “What is Intercom”.\n      3. Three detailed sections on the main components of the topic – group these logically under clear headings. Always include at least one asset for each section.\n         - For example, if the guide is about AI in support, sections might include Setup, Use Cases, limitations, and Measurement.\n      4. Pricing is mandatory and must be provided in FULL, COMPLETE PLANS, directly from the official pricing page. DO NOT skip, estimate, or partially include it.\n      5. A conclusion – recap the main points and include a visual summary if helpful.\n      6. A CTA for company name – connect how company name fits into the guide's topic or solves part of the outlined challenge.\n      \n      Always include links to relevant sites whenever something with a link is mentioned.\n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **News**\n      \n      News pieces need to be very short (500-750 words) and be factual and concise. Use the following template to help inform your news post and adapt it to your topic and keyword.\n      \n      1. Headline/Title: Concisely state the piece of news including a key benefit or impact/interesting spin.\n      2. Explain the news or update factually and concisely. Use links to sources, and quotes, at every appropriate opportunity.\n      3. Why it matters section to help connect this to relevant topics for company name AI or other AI topics.\n      4. Who this affects to explain briefly the key stakeholders or groups of people/companies that will most likely be impacted by it\n      5. What's next includes what that impact might look like or suggested upcoming similar events\n      6. Conclusion and CTA to company name - relate the topic to company name in some way.\n      \n      Your news article relies on being considered 'trustworthy', so ensure you include quotes, links, and sources where you can.\n      \n      \n      ---\n      \n      ### **Review**\n      \n      A review blog evaluates a product, tool, or service. It should be structured, transparent, and helpful for decision-making.\n      \n      Create a variation of the title with a more personal and relatable angle, something that feels like a first-hand experience or personal story. For example: My honest Pipedrive review after using it for 16+ months\n      \n      Your review should contain:\n      \n      1. An introduction – briefly explain what's being reviewed and why it's relevant to your audience. This should always have a screenshot asset suggestion of the relevant thing being reviewed.\n      2. A specs/overview section – include key facts like pricing, features, supported platforms, and ideal users. Use tables where appropriate.\n      3. A breakdown by criteria – use consistent subheadings (e.g., Usability, Integrations, Support, Value for Money).\n         - Each section should include pros, cons, and an overall take.\n      4. A table summarising all the reviewed criteria – include scores or ratings if applicable.\n      6. A final verdict – who it's best for, and if it's worth it.\n\n",
