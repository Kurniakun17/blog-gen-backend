However, I still wanted to create it because, like me, others might be searching for new applications to use instead of Notion. So, if you’re looking for a Notion alternative — whether for your second brain or project management — this post is for you.\n\n## Appflowy\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*g4TpZlM_VasdclJuM27Q_A.png)\n\nAppflowy\n\nImagine a version of Notion that’s open-source, can be used locally, and is self-hosted. Sounds perfect, right? Well, you don’t have to imagine any longer because the application is already here. It is called [appflowy](https://www.appflowy.io/). It’s still in beta, but it looks like a really cool option. While it’s a bit simpler than Notion, it offers many of the same features. The key strength of Notion is its databases and the ability to create different linked views of those databases. Appflowy offers the same functionality, with four different views: gallery, board, calendar, and regular. You also get many of the same fields that Notion provides.\n\nOf course, it’s not yet as polished as Notion since it’s newer and hasn’t had as much time to develop. However, it looks and feels similar. Appflowy also includes some AI capabilities, like a way to interact with ChatGPT within the app, though nothing particularly groundbreaking. As a beta application, you should expect some bugs, but I haven’t encountered any so far. It’s a great choice if you want an open-source version of Notion.\n\n## Anytype\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*dzCFflutM76GollFo0-JgQ.png)\n\nAnytype website\n\n[Anytype](https://anytype.io/) is a particularly exciting option. It doesn’t just aim to be a productivity or note-taking app — it aspires to be so much more. Anytype wants to be a platform for hosting communities, a space for collaboration, and even envisions itself as an operating system. Several features make Anytype stand out. The first is that it’s object-based. Everything in Anytype revolves around objects, and you can create new ones. This form of note-taking resonates with many people; it just makes sense to them. For example, if you’re writing a note about a book, the object is a book; if you’re writing a note, the object is a note. You can create as many objects as you want, and each object has its own template. While it might seem confusing at first, once you try the app and learn object-based note-taking, it will make a lot of sense.\n\nAnytype also includes databases — two different types, in fact. One type is where you can store all objects, and the other, called “sets,” is essentially a search query for a specific object type. Both allow you to create linked views and offer various views like board, calendar, gallery, graph, and table. While Anytype doesn’t have as many properties as Notion — missing the formula field, for instance — it does offer a beautiful graph view in its databases and throughout the app.\n\n## Get Danielpourasgharian’s stories in your inbox\n\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nAnytype is already sounding great, but the most interesting aspect is that it’s open-source, local, and allows for real-time collaboration. Imagine a blend between Notion and Obsidian — that’s Anytype for you. Though still in beta, meaning there are bugs and a bit of a learning curve, it’s an excellent option if privacy and object-based note-taking are important to you.\n\n## Affine\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*KvgCJw348V0VAK-MBcb0og.png)\n\n[Affine](https://affine.pro/) is a bit different. Although Affine has a database and looks similar to Notion, the page structure and basic functionality are alike, but it offers something none of the other applications have: whiteboarding capabilities. Essentially, this is Notion with excellent whiteboarding features. The best part about these whiteboarding abilities is that they are integrated with the pages. When you make changes on the whiteboard, those changes are reflected in the page, making it perfect for writing.\n\nThe app is also open-source, which I know is important to many people, and Affine is working on a plan for self-hosting. Since the app is still in beta, bugs are to be expected, and there are a few improvements needed in both the pages and the databases. For instance, linked databases are a necessary feature. However, it’s still early days, and the app needs time to develop.\n\n## Xtiles\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aFqM5u_BDRz86X1RwyfTxg.png)\n\nXtiles\n\n[Xtiles](https://xtiles.app/workspace/personal) is the more visual option and feels more like a project manager or a tool for building a life dashboard than a traditional note-taking app. Xtiles includes databases, but they must be standalone pages, which isn’t a big deal — just something to keep in mind. The databases offer different views: gallery, calendar, table, and board. The Plus plan also includes form and timeline views. Xtiles provides many properties and will feel familiar to anyone who has used Notion.\n\nXtiles lets you build your dashboards using what they call “tiles,” which is what makes it visual. The tiles make it highly aesthetically pleasing, but the best part is that they make the app easier to learn and use compared to Notion. You create the database you want and link it to any page you like. Xtiles is a great option if you prefer a more visual app. While it’s more developed than many other options, it doesn’t feel like a note-taking app, even with the relation property in the databases that lets you connect your notes. It feels more like a project manager. If you’re looking for an app to help organize your life and want a more visual option, this is an excellent choice with a generous free plan.\n\n## Capacities\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:284/1*FOQC-Qtx8FYLuajupINOYA.jpeg)\n\nCapacities\n\nWhat makes Capacities truly shine is how it uses objects. As mentioned earlier, objects make sense to many people, but the difference between Anytype and Capacities is that Capacities feels easier to learn for most users. In my opinion, Capacities also has a better UI/UX — it’s a beautiful note-taking app, probably one of the most visually appealing I’ve tested. Additionally, Capacities offers a feature that the other apps don’t (at least not yet): journal pages, also known as daily pages. This is where you can journal, jot down tasks, or use it as an inbox. It’s a fantastic way to make quick capturing much easier. Capacities also comes with a great free plan and, out of all the options, feels the most like a pure note-taking app rather than a project manager. While the other apps lean more toward project management, Capacities excels as a note-taking tool.\n\nAll of these apps are excellent productivity tools and great alternatives to Notion if you’re looking for something new. They are all highly versatile and can be molded into exactly what you need. Ultimately, it comes down to which one you think looks better and which one you feel most comfortable with after trying them out. Test them out and pick the one that suits you best.\n\n[Productivity](https://medium.com/tag/productivity?source=post_page-----a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n[Notetaking](https://medium.com/tag/notetaking?source=post_page-----a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n[Notion](https://medium.com/tag/notion?source=post_page-----a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n[Pkm](https://medium.com/tag/pkm?source=post_page-----a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Danielpourasgharian](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*h-s3F7E6zvUOaNYOsZYN5A@2x.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@danielasgharian?source=post_page---post_author_info--a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Danielpourasgharian](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*h-s3F7E6zvUOaNYOsZYN5A@2x.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@danielasgharian?source=post_page---post_author_info--a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\nFollow\n\n[**Written by Danielpourasgharian**](https://medium.com/@danielasgharian?source=post_page---post_author_info--a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n[819 followers](https://medium.com/@danielasgharian/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\n· [16 following](https://medium.com/@danielasgharian/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--a999584d0ef5---------------------------------------)\n\nPKM nerd and I mostly write about tools and tech.

Its power users go as far to organise their personal and professional lives in Notion, solely. It works without a hitch, combining a little bit of everything _you_ want, the _way_ you want. The caveat? You need to _know_ which way is the best. And the best way is often subjective.\n\nThis challenge becomes exponentially more evident in teams. Should import and link a Sheets link or just build a Notion database? Do you need to quickly verify a non-wiki page? Or should you just paste another doc link and comment ‘verified’ because that’s the way your previous company used to fo it.\n\nWhen every team member picks their own ‘best’ way, Notion becomes a mess. And it becomes impossible to find information, use it, and scale it with your team’s growing work.\n\nIf you’ve been on the hunt for a [good alternative to Notion](https://slite.com/learn/notion-vs-slite), we feel you. Researching for this guide took us hours of shortlisting a 100 tools and then manually testing 20 of them. There’s some promising tools that have built on Notion’s fallbacks, let’s look at them.\n\n## **What makes the best Notion alternative for project management?**\n\nThe best Notion alternative for you depends on this question\n\nWhy are you moving away from Notion in the first place?\n\nSick of Notion’s slow speed? There’s a Notion alternative for that.\n\nWant more features than Notion offers? There’s a Notion alternative for that.\n\nWant a more solid project management architecture with advanced features like Kanban boards, Gantt charts, and calendar integration? There’s a different Notion alternative for that.\n\n### **Our criteria for evaluation**\n\nWe personally tested every tool, went through their G2/reddit reviews to get a customer sentiment, and broadly judge the following criteria:\n\n1. Daily driver worthiness: While testing tools, we understood that all-in-tools sacrifice user-friendliness while adding features to their product. It overwhelms the first-time user, especially non-tech savvy folks, which discourages them from using the tool as a daily driver everyday.\n2. AI: Following the AI boom, SaaS apps are adding AI features to simplify basic tasks like summarisation, organisation, etc. These are highly time saving and help employees work more efficiently on grunt work.\n3. Stand out features: Every tool has a focus area where it shines, and maybe it’s a gamechanger to you! We also consider advanced project management features such as workflow automation, dashboards, forms, and AI assistance for project management and collaboration.\n4. Pricing: Notion is one of those tools with accounts for 100% of the team members. Which is why, scaling Notion becomes pricey for mid-size to larger organisations. The goal should be to find a simple tool that doesn’t burn your pocket with yearly subscriptions.\n\nLet’s get to the list, shall we now?\n\n## **The 10 Best Notion alternatives**\n\nThe 10 best Notion alternatives are:\n\n01. Slite if you want to build a great [internal wiki](https://slite.com/blog/how-to-build-a-company-wiki-that-doesnt-suck)\n02. Nuclino if you want to collaboratively take notes\n03. Archbee if you want to host documentation\n04. Helpjuice if you want a customer-facing help centre\n05. Coda if you want to build native apps/buttons\n06. ClickUp if you want robust and cheap project management\n07. Airtable if you want powerful database and visualisation features\n08. Asana if you want enterprise-grade project management\n09. Basecamp if you want user-friendly project management\n10. Confluence if you want to stay in the Atlassian ecosystem\n\nWe’ve picked the top 10 alternatives above based on what Notion-leavers usually expect from their new tools. All of them like the ability of an all-in-one but often need 1-2 core features. There are many Notion alternatives available, so let’s continue.\n\n## **Slite**\n\nIf you’re tired of getting lost in Notion’s endless possibilities, Slite might be your new best friend. It’s like Notion’s more organised cousin who actually remembers where they put things.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/9ef8f3e8fbe41307dd343e2ab12c9a8f0dbb6763-1440x900.jpg?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nYou know what is Slite’s main selling point? Team-wide adoption.\n\nPeople of all departments and generations find Slite to be user-friendly. No more scratching your head wondering [how to set up that perfect wiki structure](https://slite.com/blog/how-to-build-a-company-wiki-that-doesnt-suck). The interface is intuitive, and you won’t need a PhD to figure it out.\n\nWhat makes Slite so simple to use? It’s not the lack of features, let me tell you that. In fact, it has some features that Notion, Coda, other apps don’t. Slite is simple because of an opinionated feature set - Every feature in Slite exists to help you build a single source of company truth.\n\nWhat does that mean, exactly? Its writing, editing, and management features are intuitive, and help you keep your [Knowledge Base](https://slite.com/learn/what-is-a-knowledge-base) fresh.\n\nYou start with a simple, fast, minimal WYSIWYG editor. You can use it exactly like Notion’s editor. It also supports inline embeds and databases like Notion, so it’ll ensure that you don’t have to change the rest of your tech stack.\n\nWhen it comes to managing info, your team won’t have to second-guess anymore. You can verify Slite docs for however long you want. And for the day that docs get outdated, Slite is incredibly easy to clean up.\n\nPrompt “Show me all empty and unverified docs by me” in the Knowledge Management Panel.\n\nPress Select all.\n\nArchive. And boom, you’re done.\n\nImagine, 100’s of docs getting de-cluttered, verified, organised within minutes.\n\nBut here's something we discovered while building Slite: even the best knowledge base only captures part of your team's critical information. The real context often lives in Slack discussions, Linear ticket comments, GitHub issues, and Google Drive brainstorms. Your official docs tell the \"what,\" but the informal conversations reveal the \"why\" and \"how.\"\n\nThat's why our team also built [Super.work](https://super.work/) \\- the world's most accurate enterprise search, not to replace knowledge bases, but to bridge the gap between structured documentation and scattered conversations. When someone searches for \"our mobile deployment process,\" they get your Slite documentation plus the recent engineering discussion about deployment challenges, the Slack thread where the team debugged the latest issue, and the Linear ticket tracking the infrastructure updates.\n\nThink of it as extending Slite's single source of truth concept across your entire digital workspace. Your knowledge base becomes the foundation, while Super ensures no critical context gets lost in the tools where work actually happens.\n\nPrice-wise, it won’t break the bank at $8 per user per month. And with a G2 score of 4.6, it seems like most users are pretty happy with what they’re getting.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Notion alternative that won’t make you want to pull your hair out, Slite’s worth a shot.\n\n## **Nuclino**\n\nIf Slite is Notion’s organised cousin, Nuclino is its minimalist writer friend who believes less is more.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/228a2702186c74fec93163c717bb3271edac6fc1-1600x1067.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nNuclino’s standout feature? Simplicity, hands down. The interface is clean, uncluttered, and refreshingly straightforward. Still, it gives you all the features you’d need for day-to-day brainstorming and note-taking. Kanban board? Check. Mind map? Check. Knowledge graph? Check.\n\nNuclino packs a punch with its mind map feature, which lets you visualize your content in a way that makes connections crystal clear. It’s perfect for those “aha!” moments when you’re trying to link ideas together.\n\nNuclino also jumps on the AI bandwagon, but in a way that doesn’t feel gimmicky. The AI editing and image generation features are there when you need them, without overwhelming you with options you’ll never use.\n\nAt $5 per user per month, Nuclino is wallet-friendly, especially for smaller teams. And with a G2 score of 4.7, it seems users are loving its no-nonsense approach.\n\nIs Nuclino for everyone? Probably not. If you’re looking for complex project management or robust databases, you might find it lacking. But for teams with simple workflows who just want an easy way to collaborate and share knowledge, Nuclino could be your new go-to. It is a great Notion alternative for teams with simple workflows.\n\n## **Archbee**\n\nIt’s the tool for teams who want their documentation to look good enough to frame, but don’t want to spend hours fiddling with formatting.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/31da167a3548a0bfbda822616164af5382a111f8-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nArchbee’s UI is so sleek and simple that you’d enjoy documentation. But here’s the catch - sometimes Archbee can be a bit… unreliable.\n\nLet’s talk about the elephant in the room: bugs. Archbee’s editor has been known to throw tantrums and crash more often than a toddler refusing naptime. G2 users are torn - they love the tool’s lightweight feel and ease of use, but some are hating the overt focus on shipping new features over working on quality.\n\nUsing Archbee for internal use can _still_ be great. Using Archbee with external collaborators is where you’d be a little wary. The buggy editor makes it a gamble when working with clients or freelancers.\n\nAccording to a G2 comment’s reply, the CEO, Dragos Bulugean, has acknowledged the issues and says they’re pumping the brakes on new features to focus on ironing out the kinks. Let’s hope it works!\n\nPrice-wise, Archbee starts with the base pack of $50/month, making it attractive for small teams who don’t want to break the bank on [documentation tools](https://slite.com/learn/software-documentation). And despite its quirks, it’s still pulling a respectable 4.5 on G2.\n\nSo, who’s Archbee for? Small teams who prioritize a great UI, aren’t fazed by a few hiccups, and are willing to bet on Archbee.\n\n## **Helpjuice**\n\nHelpjuice is the documentation equivalent of that friend who always tells you exactly what you need to hear, no frills attached.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/fdc27e02854e9e84235d8a0255280d23c9aeb2b5-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nHelpjuice’s claim to fame? Keeping things simple and on-brand. The UI is clean and easy to navigate.\n\nBut here’s the kicker - Helpjuice is a bit like that one-trick pony at the circus. It does its trick really well, but don’t expect a full acrobatic performance. The feature set is limited, and if you’re looking for AI capabilities or in-depth analytics, you might be left wanting more.\n\nOne thing Helpjuice does have going for it is customer support. Users rave about the support team, which is a refreshing change.\n\nPrice-wise, Helpjuice starts at $120 for up to 4 users. It’s not exactly pocket change, especially considering all plans have the same features. You’re paying for simplicity and support here, folks.\n\nHelpjuice is pulling a solid 4.6 on G2, suggesting users are generally happy with what they’re getting. But remember, this isn’t a tool for teams looking to push the boundaries of what a knowledge base can do.\n\nSo, who’s Helpjuice for? It’s perfect for teams or technical writers who prioritize great customer service and want a straightforward, good-looking knowledge base.\n\nIf you’re after a no-fuss solution and don’t mind the lack of bells and whistles, Helpjuice might be what you need.\n\n## **Coda**\n\nIf Notion is the Swiss Army knife of productivity tools, Coda is trying to be the entire toolbox.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/48157873c03a70bafafac58d293a0247f2a1b75b-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nCoda’s standout feature? Apps. While other tools are playing catch-up, Coda’s built-in application capabilities let you create custom solutions that could potentially replace tools like [monday.com](https://monday.com/) or Productboard.\n\nBut with great power, comes great complexity.\n\nCoda’s learning curve is steep. It’s packed with features, which is great if you know what you’re doing, but can be overwhelming if you don’t. It’s one of the most mentioned cons of Coda on G2.\n\nCoda breaks down into four main components:\n\n1. Trackers (supercharged spreadsheets)\n2. Applications (build buttons, formulae, visualisations on top of your docs/spreadsheets)\n3. Hubs (for organizing your docs)\n4. Writeups (their version of collaborative docs)\n\nIt’s trying to be your one-stop-shop for all things productivity.\n\nPerformance at scale is Coda’s Achilles’ heel. The learning curve is steep, making it challenging to implement in mid-sized to large enterprises without significant onboarding. Users often struggle to figure out the optimal way to use the tool due to its complexity.\n\nPerformance at scale is another issue. As projects grow and more data is added, users report slowdowns and difficulties managing larger workspaces.\n\nCoda’s pricing model is unique. They use ‘Maker’ billing, where you only pay for users who create and edit docs. This can be cost-effective for teams with many viewers but few content creators.\n\nWith a G2 score of 4.7, Coda is well-regarded by those who’ve mastered its complexities. It’s best suited for small teams of tech-savvy builders or larger teams with dedicated Coda experts to manage the infrastructure.\n\n## **ClickUp**\n\nClickUp started as a project management tool but has evolved into “one tool to replace them all”(their words).\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/d328145c8570401e7361154016a2663e6eaa57e4-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nIt offers a wide range of features including docs, projects, chats, AI, whiteboards, dashboards, forms, and time tracking.\n\nThough, the standout feature of ClickUp is its best-in-class project management automations and workflows. These powerful tools can significantly streamline cross-team collaboration and reduce the busywork of updating and creating tickets. It is a robust project management platform with advanced features.\n\nHowever, ClickUp’s comprehensive feature set can be overwhelming for beginners. The sheer scope of implementing “one tool to replace them all” is not suitable for every team. Many current customers were initially attracted by ClickUp’s excellent project management capabilities but struggle to adopt its newer features.\n\nFor scaling companies, ClickUp isn’t yet stable enough to be the ‘everything work app’ for all employees. The platform’s ambitious goal of replacing multiple tools often leads to complexity that can hinder full adoption across an organization.\n\nPricing-wise, ClickUp offers a free plan and starts at $7 per user for small teams, making it accessible for various team sizes and budgets.\n\nWith a G2 score of 4.6, ClickUp is well-regarded by many users. It’s particularly suited for managers who want to simplify cross-team collaboration. Project managers or even social media managers can leverage ClickUp to bring different stakeholders together and set up powerful workflows.\n\n## **Airtable**\n\nOne of the internet’s favourite database tools, Airtable, combines project management databases, offering a unique approach to organising work.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/c34350aca67f4d114e7f669239037dba973a2bef-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nThe standout feature of Airtable is its ability to visualise data from tables and databases. This makes it an excellent tool for teams that need to present complex information in an easily digestible format.\n\nIt’s especially useful for data-heavy professionals like analysts, performance marketers, finance teams, accounting, etc.\n\nYou can quickly create forms, have their data come into airtable, and build a low-fi dashboard with Airtable.\n\nWhile Airtable gives a comprehensive feature set, some users find themselves overwhelmed. Sometimes, Airtable can leave users with a nagging feeling of “not knowing what they don’t know,” potentially limiting their ability to fully leverage the tool.\n\nPricing starts with a free plan, with paid plans beginning at $20 per seat monthly. This pricing structure can make Airtable a significant investment for larger teams. It is a free alternative with a free plan available.\n\nWith a G2 score of 4.6, Airtable is well-regarded by many users. It’s particularly suited for client-facing teams managing multiple projects who need to present data in visually appealing ways.\n\n## **Asana**\n\nAh, Asana. For those who don’t know already, Asana is the go-to project management tool for mid-sized and growing companies.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/779265400ffe94830152c4e901267f034c1bc01d-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nThe standout feature of Asana is its reliability. Users consistently praise its dependable performance and intuitive interface, making it a trustworthy choice for teams of all sizes.\n\nAsana is a great tool for teams that need to manage complex projects with lots of moving parts. It’s especially helpful for product managers, marketing teams, and software development groups who need to keep track of multiple tasks and deadlines.\n\nThe thing that makes Asana so great is its focus. It doesn’t try to be everything to everyone. Instead, it focuses on providing a clear [overview of project](https://slite.com/templates/project-summary) progress and making it easy for teams to visualize their work in a way that works for them.\n\nThat said, Asana isn’t perfect. It doesn’t offer all the features of some all-in-one platforms. But if you’re looking for a tool that’s specifically designed for project management, Asana is a great option.\n\nAsana has a free plan for teams of up to 10 users, and paid plans start at $10.99 per user per month. This makes it accessible for small teams while still providing value for larger organizations.\n\nOverall, Asana is a solid choice for enterprise-level teams and _huge,_ long-term projects.\n\n## **Basecamp**\n\nBasecamp is a laid-back project management and chat tool that’s super easy to learn. It’s perfect for teams who want to get up and running fast, without spending a ton of time on training.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/75dfd4376b461448a8689608fdf5b18296813ce2-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nIt’s not as feature-rich as some other tools out there, but it’s got everything you need to stay organized and [communicate](https://slite.com/blog/over-communication-is-underrated) effectively with your team. No fancy stuff like advanced document editing or databases, just the basics like to-dos, messages, chat, docs, and automated check-ins.\n\nOne thing that’s really cool about Basecamp is that it has unlimited users for a flat rate of $299/month. This makes it super cost-effective for larger teams or organizations with lots of projects.\n\nOverall, Basecamp is a great choice for teams who want an easy-to-use, communication-centric project management tool. If you’re looking for something simple and straightforward, without all the bells and whistles, Basecamp is definitely worth checking out.\n\n## **Confluence**\n\nConfluence is a collaborative [documentation tool](https://slite.com/learn/technical-documentation) of Atlassian’s “everything business app” suite. Like other ecosystem-focused-apps, it best plays with Atlassian products.\n\n![Imported image from Webflow](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/6f141f0b27e3c2ee5b7bd6d262542f729245cb43-1600x1066.png?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nOne of the best things about Confluence is how well it works with other Atlassian tools, like Jira. If you’re already using Jira or planning to, Confluence is a great choice. Confluence has a lot of features that make it easy to create and manage documents. You can work on documents with your team in real-time, keep track of changes, and choose from a bunch of templates to get started. You can also connect Confluence with other tools and services you use. It is an open source alternative for teams using Atlassian products.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Confluence can be a bit tricky to figure out at first. It might take some time to get the hang of it, especially if you’re not used to other Atlassian tools.\n\nThe pricing for Confluence is pretty fair. There’s a free plan for teams up to 10 people, and paid plans start at $8.15 per person per month. If you have a bigger team, you can get a discount.\n\nConfluence is a popular tool, especially for teams that use Atlassian products. It’s particularly useful for software developers, IT departments, and other tech teams that need to keep track of their work and communicate with each other.\n\nOverall, Confluence is a great choice if you’re looking for a collaborative workspace tool that integrates well with Atlassian products.\n\n## **Choosing the best Notion alternative**\n\nThe ideal Notion alternative for you will depend on your specific needs and reasons for seeking a replacement. Consider these factors when making your decision:\n\n- **Cost:** If pricing is a primary concern, Basecamp offers a flat rate for unlimited users, while Asana provides competitive per-user pricing.\n- **Features:** For those requiring more robust features, ClickUp and Coda offer extensive capabilities that can rival or even surpass Notion in certain areas, including advanced project management.\n- **Speed:** If speed is an issue, Airtable and Asana are known for their performance, especially when handling larger datasets.\n- **Reliability and user-friendliness:** Asana is recognized for its dependability, and Basecamp is easy to learn and implement across teams.\n- **Ecosystem integration:** If you heavily rely on Atlassian products, Confluence is the optimal choice for seamless integration.\n- **Data visualization:** Airtable excels in presenting complex data in a clear and understandable format.\n- **Project management:** ClickUp and Asana provide powerful project management functionalities.\n\nKeep in mind that no single tool is perfect for everyone.\n\nIt’s advisable to test a few options that align with your most critical requirements. Prioritize user adoption, as even the most feature-rich tool will be ineffective if your team finds it difficult to use consistently.\n\n‍\n\n![Ishaan Gupta](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dnsgqii5/production/ae11058e11ba65264c3577312ac71c0020942559-720x720.webp?auto=format&q=75&dpr=1)\n\nWritten by\n\nIshaan Gupta is a writer at Slite.

I tried a few alternatives and here's what I think of them.\n\n- [![Ankush Das](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d098097d2a43d2fc1f0d31327f8288a6?s=512&d=mm&r=g)](https://itsfoss.com/author/ankush/ \"Ankush Das\")\n\n[Ankush Das](https://itsfoss.com/author/ankush/)\n\n04 Dec 20248 min read [14 comments](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#fastcomments-widget)\n\nOn this page\n\n1. [1\\. AFFiNE](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#1-affine)\n2. [2\\. AppFlowy](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#2-appflowy)\n3. [3\\. Anytype (Source Available)](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#3-anytype-source-available)\n4. [4\\. Docmost](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#4-docmost)\n5. [5\\. Logseq](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#5-logseq)\n6. [Wrapping Up](https://itsfoss.com/notion-alternatives/#wrapping-up)\n\n[![Warp Terminal](https://itsfoss.com/assets/images/warp.webp)](https://www.warp.dev/?utm_source=its_foss&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=linux_launch)\n\nI have tried numerous online tools to keep my life organized, and I constantly look for a better tool, even if I settle with one in the present.\n\nIn the journey of exploring such tools, [Notion](https://notion.grsm.io/itsfoss?ref=itsfoss.com) is probably my super favorite. Whether you are looking for a [second brain app](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-second-brain-apps/), something to manage team tasks, or to jot down ideas, Notion is an all-in-one app.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not an open source app or the most privacy-focused solution out there.\n\nSo, if you want something that does a better job at taking control of your data, offers a reviewable source-code, or just offers something different, there are some alternatives you can choose instead.\n\nWhile I still swear by Notion for personal usage, I do see other choices worthy of a switch for various users. Hence, I shall highlight the unique traits for each of them.\n\n📋\n\n[Notion](https://notion.grsm.io/itsfoss?ref=itsfoss.com) is a unique and competitive offering in itself. So, it is tough to find an exact replacement. All the available options are mere choices that you can go for instead as per different requirements, these may never be able to replace Notion.\n\n## 1\\. AFFiNE\n\n[![affine screenshot](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_e.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_e.png)\n\n✅ Local-first\n\n✅ Open Source\n\n✅ Visualization / Drawing\n\n✅ Note-taking / Journal\n\n✅ Team collaboration\n\n✅ AI assistant ( _paid_)\n\n✅ Self-host\n\n❌Calendar\n\n❌Two-factor Authentication ( _cloud_)\n\n❌Google Drive/Slack connections\n\n❌No mobile apps\n\n[AFFiNE](https://affine.pro/?ref=itsfoss.com) is a good **open source alternative to Notion** and a couple of other tools. At first glance, **I see a striking resemblance to the user interface**, making it look like a clone, which can be a good/bad thing as per your taste 😉\n\nThat being said, AFFiNE tries to do more than what Notion has to offer. It focuses on being local-first, and also offers drawing capabilities as standout features.\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_a.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_a.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_g-2.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_g-2.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_i.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/AFFiNE_i.png)\n\nConsidering it does not rely on the cloud, you can choose to use it completely offline (on your browser, or as an app).\n\n💭\n\nWhile I like it overall, it did disappoint me when I tried to import my data from Notion ( _it failed!_). Maybe while we publish this, the issue is fixed, and the migration is swift. Until then, I would recommend this to users who hesitated using Notion for being proprietary or if you do not have a lot of data to copy.\n\n[AFFiNE](https://affine.pro/?ref=itsfoss.com)\n\n## 2\\. AppFlowy\n\n[![appflowy screenshot](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-2024.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-2024.png)\n\n✅ Local-first\n\n✅ Open Source\n\n✅ Note-taking / Journal\n\n✅ AI assistant ( _paid unlocks more usage_)\n\n✅ Self-host\n\n✅ Android and iOS apps\n\n✅ Templates\n\n✅ Collaboration (cloud)\n\n✅ Notion Import (cloud only)\n\n❌Calendar\n\n❌Two-factor Authentication ( _cloud_)\n\n❌Google Drive/Slack connections\n\n❌No Notion import\n\nAppFlowy is an **offline Notion alternative**. Unlike Notion, it is **not available via the web browser**. Yes, it does offer cloud features, but you need to utilize the **desktop app** for it.\n\nI have been trying the app on and off for a year or more, only to realize that it gets improved with every update. AppFlowy tries to give you an open source Notion replacement, but with its touch. So, it will not feel like a clone when you use it.\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-3.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-3.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-2.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-2.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-1.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/appflowy-1.png)\n\nYou just need to hit the \" **Anonymous**\" button on its start screen to use it offline without any account syncing feature.\n\nAnd, of course, the AI features are exclusive to paid customers (and only if you are signed in using an online account).\n\nThe [notion import feature for AppFlowy](https://docs.appflowy.io/docs/guides/import-from-notion?ref=itsfoss.com) seems to require an online account, which is a bummer, but it offers mobile apps for both Android and iOS. Overall, it provides a balanced user experience.\n\n💭\n\nI find AppFlowy as a simpler alternative to Notion if you do not need all Notion-like abilities. You can focus on managing tasks, to-do lists, and organize notes with AppFlowy just fine. And, there is a little extra in the form of templates available. So, you can use some of the same Notion templates here as well.\n\n[AppFlowy](https://appflowy.io/?ref=itsfoss.com)\n\n## 3\\. Anytype (Source Available)\n\n[![anytype screenshot of its homescreen](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-home.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-home.png)\n\n✅ Local-first & Decentralized\n\n✅ Source-Available\n\n✅ Note-taking / Journal\n\n✅ Notion Import\n\n✅ Self-host\n\n✅ Templates\n\n✅ Android and iOS apps\n\n❌Calendar\n\n❌Google Drive/Slack connections\n\n❌Cloud sync\n\n❌Not Open Source Entirely\n\nAnytype is a local-first, and peer-to-peer focused app that mimics Notion functionality closely. You can create pages ( _a.k.a. Objects here_) like the original app, and add elements to it to make it a note, to-do list, sheet, and so on. You can even use it for project management.\n\nIt is free to get started and offers paid plans. You can install the app on Linux ( _deb, rpm, AppImage_), Windows, and macOS.\n\nUnlike others, it is a decentralized alternative to the options I mention here. Your data will be synced cross-platform with the help of a key generated when you start ( _do not lose it_). And, all of it is encrypted and resides on your device. So, if you are a privacy enthusiast, you will love this!\n\nThe protocols are open source (with MIT license), however, the app itself is [source-available](https://news.itsfoss.com/open-source-source-available/?ref=itsfoss.com). If you are not too picky with the license, it is a solid app that does it nearly as good as Notion.\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-login.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-login.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-key.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-key.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-templates.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/anytype-templates.png)\n\nAnytype does offer a nice Notion import feature as well. However, it is not perfect ( _which they have mentioned in their documentation_). So, you will have to do a little work after importing the data to organize it appropriately.\n\n💭\n\nI find Anytype one of the best alternatives to Notion with a solid focus on privacy. If you do not mind the source-available license, you should like the experience, as it feels just like using a local-version of Notion.\n\n[Anytype](https://anytype.io/?ref=itsfoss.com)\n\n## 4\\. Docmost\n\n[![a screenshot of docmost running using pikapods](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-home-2.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-home-2.png)\n\n✅ Open Source\n\n✅ Wiki / Documentation\n\n✅ Self-host\n\n✅ Version History\n\n✅ Team Collaboration\n\n❌ Templates\n\n❌Calendar\n\n❌Google Drive/Slack connections\n\n❌No desktop or mobile apps\n\n❌Notion Import\n\nIf you are all about building wikis and documentation pages, Docmost is the next best thing for you.\n\nIt is an open source project with no hosted offering ( _in beta phase when writing this_). And, it is entirely a self-host option using Docker at the moment.\n\nI used [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/?ref=itsfoss.com) to deploy it in a single click and it worked liked charm.\n\n🚀\n\nQuickly and effortlessly [deploy Docmost with PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/apps?ref=itsfoss.com) for as less as $1.9 per month. Try it with $5 free credit.\n\nYou get a Notion-like user interface, and you can build separate spaces to collaborate and create wikis/documents as per your requirements. The editor looks just like Notion. So, you will feel right at home.\n\nUnfortunately, it does not include a Notion import feature, and does not offer a marketplace for templates (yet). Maybe they could add it in the future after its stable release.\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-editor-3.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-editor-3.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-settings.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-settings.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-theme.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/docmost-theme.png)\n\nI think this is a suitable option for users laser-focused on creating one type of document.\n\n💭\n\nIf you are an avid web user, do not need mobile apps, and prefer self-hosting, Docmost is going to be an interesting choice. You need to remember that this is in active development. So, you would rather not rely on it for everything, but only as an experiment to start with.\n\n[Docmost](https://docmost.com/?ref=itsfoss.com)\n\n## 5\\. Logseq\n\n[![logseq screenshot](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-main.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-main.png)\n\n✅ Privacy-focused\n\n✅ Open Source\n\n✅ Note-taking / Knowledge Base\n\n✅ Notion Import\n\n✅ Android and iOS apps\n\n✅ Logseq Sync and Version History (a bit complex to set up)\n\n🟡 Self-host\n\n❌Calendar\n\n❌Google Drive/Slack connections\n\n❌Notion Import\n\n❌Templates\n\nI use Notion as a second brain app (or you could assume it as a knowledge base app). So, if you are like me, this is a great open source alternative tool for knowledge management.\n\nLogseq is one of the best [second brain open source apps](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-second-brain-apps/) that can replace Notion for users who want to build a knowledge base. Some users have managed to self-host it. However, there is insufficient documentation for it considering it is still in its _beta phase_. So, it may not be fruitful to try it out.\n\nIt is more of an alternative to [Obsidian](https://itsfoss.com/obsidian-markdown-editor/). Hence, it involves a learning curve to get started.\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-add-folder.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-add-folder.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-whiteboard.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-whiteboard.png)\n\n[![Gallery Image](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-settings.png)](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2024/11/logseq-settings.png)\n\nIn a nutshell, you can organize all your thoughts, and connect them to build the ultimate knowledge base to refer to. Sure, it is not as easy as it sounds, but if you like it ( _and learn how to do it right_), you are in for an exciting experience.\n\n💭\n\nI would not recommend this to beginners (unless you are looking for an adventure). But, if you are fed up with all kinds of note-taking and knowledge base apps, and often overwhelmed with the information you need to record, learning to use Logseq should be useful.\n\n[Logseq](https://logseq.com/?ref=itsfoss.com)\n\n**Suggested Read 📖**\n\n[13 Useful Tips on Organizing Notes Better With Obsidian\\\\\n\\\\\nUtilize Obsidian knowledge tool more effectively with these helpful tips and tweaks.\\\\\n\\\\\n![](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/icon/android-chrome-192x192-101.png)It's FOSSSreenath\\\\\n\\\\\n![](https://itsfoss.com/content/images/thumbnail/tips-organizing-notes-obsidian.png)](https://itsfoss.com/obsidian-tips/)\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nWhen looking for a Notion alternative, we need to take some pointers into account, such as the editor experience, revision history, the type of document, collaboration, sync, and a couple of others.\n\nFor some, it is just the UI, and for others, it is all about the functionality.\n\nI hope these options should work for all kinds of preferences.\n\nFurthermore, if you are on the lookout for something like Trello and Notion mixed up in one, you can try self-hosting [Focalboard](https://www.focalboard.com/?ref=itsfoss.com). It offers a personal desktop app as well (but that did not work in my testing).\n\n💬 _What do you think about the Notion alternatives mentioned? Did we miss one of your favorites?

When you click some of the links on this page, we may earn a commission._ [_Learn more_](https://zapier.com/blog/affiliate-commission/) _._\n\n[Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/what-is-notion) is a special app. Starting from an empty screen, you add notes and documents in a freeform way. Then, when the original page is too crowded, you create your first database and the possibilities explode: you can create a custom productivity system and change it as you evolve.\n\nBut productivity is evolving. Knowledge management platforms may demand too much maintenance; automation might not be completely seamless; and AI-powered isn't the same as AI-native. Depending on your needs, Notion might not fit the bill anymore.\n\nIf you've been considering a Notion alternative—or strapping a dozen apps together to get all the features you want—you're in the right place. I've been keeping an eye on this category for three years now. I've considered over 100 Notion alternatives with similar features, and while most aren't even close in terms of user experience, there are more and more worthy possibilities. Let's check them out: the best Notion alternatives.\n\n## The best Notion alternatives\n\n- [Coda](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#coda) for powerful formulas and databases\n\n- [Mem](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#mem) for AI-powered personal knowledge management\n\n- [Tana](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#tana) for turning daily notes into networked hubs\n\n- [Microsoft Loop](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#microsoft-loop) for Microsoft 365 users\n\n- [Slite](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#slite) for AI knowledge management for teams\n\n- [Upbase](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#upbase) for collaborating with your team\n\n- [Anytype](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#anytype) for privacy, security, and data relationships\n\n- [Scrintal](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#scrintal) for mind mapping\n\n- [Obsidian](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#obsidian) for fearless tinkerers\n\n\nAnd, of course, [Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#notion) itself.\n\n## What makes the best Notion alternative?\n\n##### How we evaluate and test apps\n\nOur best apps roundups are written by humans who've spent much of their careers using, testing, and writing about software. Unless explicitly stated, we spend dozens of hours researching and testing apps, using each app as it's intended to be used and evaluating it against the criteria we set for the category. We're never paid for placement in our articles from any app or for links to any site—we value the trust readers put in us to offer authentic evaluations of the categories and apps we review. For more details on our process, read the full rundown of [how we select apps to feature on the Zapier blog](https://zapier.com/blog/selecting-apps/).\n\nIdeally, a great Notion alternative gives you the freedom to create your own productivity system—your network of documents, databases, and references—without forcing an inflexible user experience on you.\n\nA bit like a sandbox video game, this app category (which doesn't really have a name yet, but I've seen Work OS and Digital Workspace rising as possible ones) gives you the possibility to mix and combine different elements to create your or your team's all-in-one workspace.\n\nEach of the picks on this list has something unique to offer, along with some twists on the original experience you're used to. But to start, I evaluated all the apps I tested using the same criteria:\n\n- **Document and** [**note-taking features**](https://zapier.com/blog/notion-note-taking-template/). How easy is it to create, format, share, and embed content? This blank-slate document vibe is the bread-and-butter of Notion, so I wanted to be sure the alternatives stacked up.\n\n- **Project management and collaboration features.** Can you create to-do lists? Kanban boards? What about leaving comments on documents? Can you mention coworkers?\n\n- **Data organization.** Notion offers databases to help you organize your pages and create systems, so I looked for equivalent features: folders, tags, views, or other original methods.\n\n- **Performance and user experience.** I was paying attention to speed, how the search function works (and where it searches), as well as other details, like the quality of the user interface, onboarding experiences, and available support.\n\n- **All-in-one potential.** Based on all the above, could this app reliably hold all your information and processes in one place without requiring you to connect loads of apps together?\n\n\nIn making my final picks, I tried to make sure that each app was relatively well-rounded, even if each one takes a unique approach.\n\n## The best Notion alternatives at a glance\n\n|  | **Best for** | **Standout feature** | **Pricing** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [**Notion**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#notion) | The gold standard of an all-in-one workspace | Flexible databases with various views | Free plan available; paid plans from $12/user/month |\n| [**Coda**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#coda) | Powerful formulas and databases | A structured approach to workspaces | Free plan available; paid plans from $12/document maker/month |\n| [**Mem**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#mem) | AI-powered personal knowledge management | AI that tags and organizes your content | Free plan available; paid plans from $12/month |\n| [**Tana**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#tana) | Turning daily notes into networked hubs | Rapid note capture and organization | Free plan available; paid plans from $10/month |\n| [**Microsoft Loop**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#microsoft-loop) | Microsoft 365 users | Loop Components for dynamic content blocks | Part of Microsoft 365 for Business starting at $12.50/user/month |\n| [**Slite**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#slite) | AI knowledge management for teams | AI-powered Ask button for instant answers | From $10/user/month |\n| [**Upbase**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#upbase) | Collaborating with your team | Very lightweight | Free plan available; paid plans from $10/user/month |\n| [**Anytype**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#anytype) | Privacy, security, and data relationships | Bidirectional linking for visual constellation charts | Free to use locally; paid plans from $5/month |\n| [**Scrintal**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#scrintal) | Mind mapping | Card organization and hierarchy features | From $6.99/month |\n| [**Obsidian**](https://zapier.com/blog/best-notion-alternatives/#obsidian) | Fearless tinkerers | Customizable with plugins and local storage | Free for personal use; paid plans from $5/month |\n\n* * *\n\n## The gold standard\n\n### [**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/) **(Web, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android)**\n\n![Notion, the gold standard of the all-in-one workspace tool](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/20tJF4PH5cVaeaWbfo3fK/6d6bc5017825148a6d26e52a14e8c262/image6.jpeg)\n\n**Notion pros:**\n\n- Extremely flexible\n\n- Generous free plan\n\n\n**Notion cons:**\n\n- Server-client sync in offline mode can create some temporary page version problems\n\n\nA list of Notion alternatives wouldn't be complete without naming the elephant in the workspace. Unique and powerful, using [Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/notion-tips/) for the first time feels like you found the One App, the app to replace them all. You can finally focus on [building your own information hub](https://zapier.com/blog/organize-your-life-with-notion/) and customizing it the way you want to.\n\nWhy is it so easy to love? The user experience is super clean. The interface is uncluttered, leaving plenty of open space for your content, with buttons disappearing to let you work undisturbed. But when you need anything, a mouse movement or typing a forward slash reveals all the tools you need to customize documents, integrate external files, or mention someone on your team.\n\nDatabases are the top feature. Easy to create and configure, you can group similar data types, label them with fields, and then create filtered views to work with them daily. No more squinting at a large list of sorted projects: just add a status field, filter by \"in progress\" to only see those you're working on, and the cognitive overwhelm you experience in the morning is gone. Later, you'll find that the Notion API lets you use databases like an actual data infrastructure, so you can build an app on top of it.\n\nNotion has been following the AI development curve, first introducing generative AI for creating and editing content in your workspace. Next, it built AI-powered search to help you surface long-lost notes from your workspace, as well as from other apps you choose to connect, such as Gmail, Microsoft SharePoint, or GitHub. More recently, it has AI agents that you can set up with instructions to carry out work in your workspace.\n\nMore than the cute icons, these AI agents can take a prompt to create or edit a database for you, transform a page from meeting notes into a project proposal, and even carry out updates in multiple pages. It works like a chat interface to interact with your workspace, making it easier to run many actions based on written instructions.\n\nIf you're here, still love Notion and want more of it, you can also grab the [Notion Calendar](https://zapier.com/blog/notion-calendar/) for planning your day, with meeting scheduling and AI meeting notes included; and try out [Notion Mail](https://zapier.com/blog/notion-mail/), which applies the database principles to your inbox and has AI-powered labeling and filters to keep it organized.\n\nYou can also [connect Notion to Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/notion/integrations), so you can upgrade your Notion experience and connect it to the other apps you use. Automatically track and update tasks, organize customer information, or log research based on activity in 8,000+ other apps—and use Zapier's built-in AI to create fully automated, intelligent systems for your work.

Coda is strong in databases, offering a slightly different philosophy that gives more control over the user experience and automation possibilities.\n\nThere are a lot of features that contribute to this. Coda Packs help you display and interact with external apps directly from your workspace. I connected Coda with Google Calendar, which unlocked a set of elements and formulas I could put in the document to show my schedule and add new events with a button. It's like a toolbox to bring Coda together with other apps, so you don't have to keep a billion tabs open to get around your workday.\n\nMore than storing your data, Coda's databases have native automation capabilities that help you run multiple changes and save time by doing so. With four triggers—a row change, time-based, on form submission, and based on a webhook—you can set up what happens next. The range of possible actions is varied, including manipulating data in the database, interacting with Packs, or even changing state management values to support more advanced workflows.\n\nBuilt on this robust infrastructure, Coda offers finer control over the data viewing interfaces when [compared with Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/coda-vs-notion/). It feels more like an app builder, actually: there's a draggable and configurable card for every data field, easy to organize in columns and rows. You can change the data displays or even hide them entirely. When you finish editing, the view sits inside your documents, and you can open it to interact with it more deeply.\n\nInching closer to that app builder aspect, Coda's formulas make your docs even more dynamic. Start by typing `=` anywhere, and away you go: calculate/transform data, reference anything outside the doc, write logic functions, and program configurable buttons to run complex actions. These work inside Coda and through the Packs I mentioned earlier, so they can interact with third-party software too.\n\nMore than summarization, chatting with your docs, and generating content, [Coda AI](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-coda-ai/) also lets you add database columns that run AI actions on the row's content, filling it automatically. This is useful, for example, for generating personalized sales emails and then sending them out via an integration. Beyond that, AI content blocks will dynamically update based on the page's content, great to keep up with what's changing. Finally, the AI reviewer can read your docs and leave comments to help you improve, as if it were someone on your team.\n\nAnd you can take advantage of it even more by [connecting Coda to Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/coda/integrations), so you can automate your business-critical workflows across your entire tech stack.

In 2025, it got a complete revamp, taking a step toward being an AI-native platform, with new ways to input and retrieve your data.\n\nPositioning itself as an AI thought partner, it introduced a new way to add data into your workspace. Typing is so 2024: start with a voice note and let AI transcribe and organize your thoughts into a new note. Need to repurpose this into a proposal or a document? Don't do it by hand: ask Mem to transform it into a new type with a prompt, ready to share with anyone you want to present it to.\n\nWhen accessing the workspace on the desktop app, I like how the tab on the right side shows you notes that might be connected to what you're writing as you write it. This creates opportunities to connect or revisit ideas you stored previously, which helps organize the workspace as you add more content and surface what you already have there. Another plus is how you can open any of the suggested notes side-by-side with the one you're currently editing, super useful to reference data as you go.\n\nThe AI chat experience is also in this tab, where you can issue commands or ask questions about your workspace. It has time awareness: you can ask about the notes you created yesterday or last week's meeting. Simply mention that in the prompt in natural language, and Mem can get to work in searching for it and making it available for you in the chat.\n\nSearching for notes got a revamp as well. In addition to displaying the traditional search results, it can also run an AI-powered deep search into your workspace to find everything you need. That said, some things were lost in this transition from Mem 1.0 to 2.0: the inbox and task management aren't there anymore, now only available as views that you can set up to create these experiences if you really value them.\n\nStill, the effort to make it more AI-native can make it a better match for personal knowledge management workflows when compared with Notion, considering how smooth input and output are. To make things even smoother, [connect Mem to Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/mem), and can bring even more data in and out of Mem. Automatically add data to Mem from all the other apps you use to create new notes without any extra effort.

With daily notes at the heart, it's a workspace ready to fill with content, classify it with Supertags, and then revisit in dedicated hubs.\n\nThe philosophy can be initially challenging to grasp, but it makes a lot of sense once you watch the intro video and start jotting down notes. After you type out the name of a task in a note, tap `#` and add the Supertag Task to it: it's now a task inside Tana, with a status and due date property. In Notion, you'd have to create a tasks database and then add a new row; in Tana, you type out your task and then assign it to a Supertag, which acts like a super database that keeps track of everything of the same type.\n\nEvery time you assign a Supertag to any note, they're stored automatically in the corresponding tab on the left side. You can choose which view you want to see them in, from outline to cards, and save all of them for easy access at the top. In the settings view, you can edit which fields each note should have, create a template for every new note, and even set custom autofill behavior using AI.\n\nSpeaking of AI, Tana promotes itself as an AI-native workspace. Start a new voice note in the Tana mobile app, and it will transcribe what you say and autofill any custom Supertag fields. When you chat with an AI model inside Tana, you can Supertag any part of its response to add it to your workspace, so you can save the best bits of a deep dive with AI. If you're having trouble finding anything, the AI-powered search can find it for you, letting you chat with your notes.\n\nTana offers a user experience that prioritizes speed when adding content into your workspace, heightened by Supertags, which make organizing your workspace a breeze. Definitely worth giving it a try and seeing if it matches the way you think and work.\n\n**Tana pricing:** Free plan includes all note and Supertag features, with 500 AI credits, 3 workspaces, 0.5 GB of storage for uploaded files and 5 MB max upload size. The Plus plan at $10/month adds meeting transcription and notifications, selecting your favorite AI model, and creating custom AI agents.\n\n## Best Notion alternative for Microsoft 365 users\n\n### [Microsoft Loop](https://loop.microsoft.com/learn) (Web)\n\n![Microsoft Loop, our pick for the best Notion alternatives for Microsoft 365 users](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/5Mtq3B0mB3KjZqA3WKDa1/db654728592279f94a397cde7df44f39/image3.jpeg)\n\n**Microsoft Loop pros:**\n\n- Deep integration with the rest of the Microsoft 365 suite, including Copilot\n\n- Offers dynamic content blocks that you can embed in other 365 apps\n\n\n**Microsoft Loop cons:**\n\n- No relational database features\n\n\nMicrosoft has been hard at work lately. If you use Office apps and have all your data on the Microsoft cloud, Microsoft Loop is a great option to tie it all together. It's not as feature-rich as Notion, but it has all the features to start gathering information and collaborating with your team without leaving the Microsoft ecosystem.\n\nYou can create documents, adding content blocks with slash commands, styling and sharing them with others as needed. There's a section where you can jot down your ideas, and you can always access these from the left-side menu, no matter which workspace you're hanging out in. New integrations this year will also let you display Figma, GitHub, Trello, and Jira content on your pages.\n\nWhen creating a new workspace, you can fill it with documents created inside Loop and also add links to the left-side menu, just in case you need to link to valuable resources quickly. You can leave comments on each block or react with emoji to let your teammates know they're on the right track.\n\nBut the best feature available is Loop Components. You can convert any content block into a component. Then, you can share it via Teams, Outlook, or Word, and the content will always be synced no matter where it's showing. It will also be updated no matter where you interact with it, so it's really handy to share live updates or gather feedback. It feels like Loop is meant to be the connector that brings all Microsoft 365 apps together, making it a great addition to the software suite.\n\nThere are AI features here, too. [Microsoft Copilot](https://zapier.com/blog/microsoft-copilot/)—the product that brings AI features to Microsoft apps—is there to generate content, rewrite text, and summarize pages for you. To unlock these features, you'll need a Microsoft Copilot Pro business subscription (they're not available in the base version).\n\n**Microsoft Loop price:** Part of the Microsoft 365 for Business subscription, starting at $12.50/user/month for the Standard tier. AI features unlocked via Microsoft Copilot, with the Business Basic + Copilot plan starting at $36/month, billed yearly.\n\n## Best Notion alternative for managing knowledge with AI features\n\n### [Slite](https://slite.com/) (Web, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows)\n\n![Slite, our pick for the best Notion alternative for AI knowledge management for teams](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1bscz7VpZ5eDCZqCrOzqKU/bea7a1571deb399d842ef0ab519d745f/image11.png)\n\n**Slite pros:**\n\n- Strong collaboration features\n\n- Top-notch knowledge verification tools\n\n\n**Slite cons:**\n\n- The user interface looks busier than Notion\n\n\nAI may still have a way to go as far as creativity goes, but it's already superb for summarizing, analyzing, and formatting data. If your workspace is a mess of information that's hard to search, Slite will help you make sense of everything.\n\nThe first place where you'll notice AI is in the _Ask_ button. It generates the answers to your questions on the spot, helping you find the information you're looking for quickly, without having to click to read documents. But if you still need to read them, there are quick links for jumping right into the action. If you don't find an answer to your question, you can assign it to a teammate straight from the search bar so they can add that information to the workspace.\n\nYou can include or exclude document types when generating AI answers, so the output only contains the data you want to see. One especially useful filter is _Verified documents only_: as you use the knowledge management features to tag which pages are current and which aren't, you can set the AI to only use the most up-to-date information and disregard the rest. You can set when verified knowledge expires, nudging you to check if it's accurate over time.\n\nBut this isn't the end of it. When you open a document and look at the bottom-right purple buttons, you can do two handy things: ask questions about the document and improve the page with AI. The experience of the latter is unique: you get a side-by-side comparison of what changed, great to see if it's better compared to the original or if there's any data drift.\n\nThese intelligent tools sit on top of a workspace app already strong for collaboration. You can organize your knowledge by team or area of specialization: simply create channels and start adding documents and collections (Slite's name for databases). The platform helps you add, structure, retrieve, and keep your truth up to date.\n\nAnd if you want to automate that, you can: [connect Slite to Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/slite/integrations), and start saving time while staying accurate. Build fully automated, AI-powered workflows for all your work—across your entire tech stack. Here are a few examples to get you started.\n\n### Create Slite docs from new Google Calendar events\n\n[Create Slite docs from new Google Calendar events](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=1561216)\n\n[Try it](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=1561216)\n\n- ![Google Calendar logo](https://zapier-images.imgix.net/storage/services/5839ae4d0567a01a65dd87d3476927c1.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.8.1&q=50&fit=crop&h=30&w=30)\n- ![Slite logo](https://zapier-images.imgix.net/storage/developer_cli/3ae2c16a660a0f57eeead84b035e454e.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.8.1&q=50&fit=crop&h=30&w=30)\n\nGoogle Calendar, Slite\n\nGoogle Calendar + Slite\n\n### Generate Slite docs for new Calendly invitees\n\n[Generate Slite docs for new Calendly invitees](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=1561219)\n\n[Try it](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=1561219)\n\n- ![Calendly logo](https://zapier-images.imgix.net/storage/services/33464c48a26a29dd29977ffb16bcca53.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.8.1&q=50&fit=crop&h=30&w=30)\n- ![Slite logo](https://zapier-images.imgix.net/storage/developer_cli/3ae2c16a660a0f57eeead84b035e454e.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.8.1&q=50&fit=crop&h=30&w=30)\n\nCalendly, Slite\n\nCalendly + Slite\n\n### Update Slite docs from new or updated Google Sheets rows\n\n[Update Slite docs from new or updated Google Sheets rows](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=1561221)\n\n[Try it](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=1561221)\n\n- ![Google Sheets logo](https://zapier-images.imgix.net/storage/services/8913a06feb7556d01285c052e4ad59d0.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.8.1&q=50&fit=crop&h=30&w=30)\n- ![Slite logo](https://zapier-images.imgix.net/storage/developer_cli/3ae2c16a660a0f57eeead84b035e454e.png?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.8.1&q=50&fit=crop&h=30&w=30)\n\nGoogle Sheets, Slite\n\nGoogle Sheets + Slite\n\n**Slite price:** Standard plan is $10/user/month\n\n## Best Notion alternative for collaborating with your team\n\n### [Upbase](https://vendors.selectsoftwarereviews.com/redirect/1764805194950x131526256002334720?p=1715808885462x244895206427328500) (Web, iOS, Android)\n\n![Upbase, our pick for the best Notion alternative for collaborating with your team](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/52jcFrJqVYRs6jdgVhArwu/fe2f7616351147c45982d2972d1629fa/image5.png)\n\n**Upbase pros:**\n\n- Lightweight all-in-one workspace\n\n- Multiple views available in the Schedule tab\n\n\n**Upbase cons:**\n\n- Limited native integrations\n\n\nNotion's freedom can be a bit too much: building your workspace can take a while to figure out, maintain, and scale. Upbase still retains some freedom but adds useful guardrails to help you bring your team together, without the ongoing maintenance.\n\nWhen you open the app in the morning, you land in the Schedule tab, so you can start planning out your day. You'll see a pad to write out the day's notes, a task list with your duties for the day—including events from Google Calendar—and an open calendar right next to it. Start by dragging the tasks from the list and dropping them into your day, timeblocking your near future. When you're ready to start working, use the native time tracker so you can see where your minutes are actually going to.\n\nThere's a project management bias here. You can click Spotlight for a board with tasks across lists based on status and My Tasks to see what you have to do tomorrow or in the next 7 days. These two views let you see all tasks across all lists, but lists is where the magic resides: these can keep track of tasks, have their own schedule, save links, files, messages, and have their own isolated chat. This makes Upbase a lightweight portfolio manager, helping you keep track of multiple projects without a lot of complexity.\n\nAs you assign these tasks to your team, they'll start popping up in their Schedule tabs as well, and your teammates can plan out their day. This flow between Schedule, lists, chat, and back again is structured enough to keep work moving forward, but open-ended enough to customize workflows and team collaboration. It invites you not to linger too much on the question \"is this the best way to organize work?\" and instead tunnel down and get it done—for people who love to optimize too much, this is actually a great thing.\n\n**Upbase pricing:** Free plan for unlimited tasks, members, storage, and 10 lists. Premium at $10/user/month unlocks unlimited lists, custom fields, automations and a wide range of project management features.\n\n## Best Notion alternative for privacy, security, and data relationships\n\n### [Anytype](https://anytype.io/) (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android)\n\n![Anytype, our pick for the best Notion alternative for privacy, security, and data relationships](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/1ksYC8hd8LhIJa9AbTgoMi/5bf18dfbff2cc44718692f13a451f601/image8.png)\n\n**Anytype pros:**\n\n- Full offline mode available\n\n- Fast\n\n\n**Anytype cons:**\n\n- Limited cloud storage\n\n\nAnytype is still in development—currently in beta—but already shows great promise as a Notion alternative. It brings its own organization philosophy to the table, so let me quickly break it down for you.\n\nEverything within Anytype is an object. I'm an object with the \"human\" property. I set relationships with the objects I create, be it documents, notes, or invoices, to name a few. An author of a book I read is an object, the books they wrote (also objects) appear in relation to the author, and the notes I've made about each book (yup, objects) are related to each book in the same way.\n\nThis kind of linking through relationships doesn't happen in just one way. Anytype has something called bidirectional linking: linking one object to another enables you to move from A to B, and also from B to A, a bit like backlinks with more features built upon it. This allows you to see information in a visual constellation chart and as a sequence of relationships, where you can navigate upstream or downstream to see how information is connected.\n\nAll data lives inside your device, encrypted by a unique passphrase assigned to you when you log in for the first time. Lost the passphrase? Goodbye, data. No one, not even the Anytype team, can recover data without the passphrase. Once you get it, keep it safe in a [password manager](https://zapier.com/blog/best-password-manager/).\n\nAnytype offers cloud servers to save your data in the cloud and to collaborate with others—enabling the \"multiplayer\" experience. But if you ever turn off the Wi-Fi, you'll still be able to work. To sync the changes with your other devices, just get in range of the internet again and wait for it to update. This is also the app's monetization model, so if you want more cloud storage and better collaboration, you'll have to hop into one of the paid plans.\n\nThe brand new Chats for shared spaces add a new way to collaborate with others inside Anytype. This is a real-time, threaded chat experience: you can drop objects into it, create and edit them there, and see everything you created together in a dedicated sidebar. Add a user experience that feels smoother every time I go back, and a range of infrastructure improvements to make it more stable, useful, and connected, and Anytype is looking great for personal and small group settings.\n\n**Anytype pricing:** Free to use locally, with 100 MB of remote storage and up to 10 shared spaces. Plus plan at $5/month includes 1GB of remote storage and unlimited shared and private spaces.\n\n## Best Notion alternative for mind mapping\n\n### [Scrintal](https://scrintal.com/) (Web, Desktop)\n\n![Scrintal, our pick for the best Notion alternative for mind mapping](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/6jbsx1w28DGkMCEZ48naX5/80ac8b3020c6a4fe737323ca0d7ab3a4/image7.jpg)\n\n**Scrintal pros:**\n\n- Gobu AI offers AI-powered research and study assistance\n\n- Good card organization and hierarchy features\n\n\n**Scrintal cons:**\n\n- Not much power beyond mind mapping\n\n\nNotion and Miro crashed into one another: the result is a powerful app called Scrintal. If you think in images and diagrams and want a more interesting user experience, you have to check this one out.\n\nThe user interface is very similar to Notion: the left-side menu contains links to pages separated by content type, starred, and recently accessed. You can also search from here. Once you're browsing the _My Desk_ section or a board you created, I recommend you collapse the menu: having the canvas fill out your entire screen is much more comfortable.\n\nThis is the end of the similarities with Notion. Now, for the Miro part of the deal. With the canvas open in its full glory, click the plus button on the left side to add a new card. Give it a title and some content. You'll notice there are four circles around the card: you can use these to click and drag to connect it to other cards. If there are none, clicking and dragging will create a new card for you, so it's faster to connect ideas without hitting the add button every time.\n\nThere are more kinds of elements that you can add to a board. You can add daily cards for journaling or tracking your progress in a project. You can add new boards as well, opening up an entirely new canvas. In addition to these, you can add text, columns (a kind of Kanban view), and web links.\n\nThere are formatting controls for the cards, so you can leverage colors and font weights to differentiate knowledge in a visual way. You can drag and rearrange everything to make the information clearer and easier to navigate. There are three card layouts—small, only title, or title and content—so you can also create hierarchies among them. When you're happy with your layout, you can invite people to see your board or publish it to the web with a link in read-only mode.\n\nYou can use this one either on your browser or in the desktop versions. It's smooth as butter to move cards and elements around, but I haven't tried zooming out with hundreds of cards with multiple content types on the screen. If you don't have a powerful computer, I recommend you separate your cards using more boards instead of keeping everything in one massive canvas.\n\n**Scrintal price:** Pro plan goes for $9/month.\n\n## Best Notion alternative for fearless tinkerers\n\n### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android)\n\n![Obsidian, our pick for the best Notion alternative for fearless tinkerers](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/pjzaSWzCG8XGhxT4Jlp3a/764336a2e8f74a54a53509e638710767/image9.png)\n\n**Obsidian pros:**\n\n- Full offline mode available\n\n- Now includes simple databases with table and card view\n\n\n**Obsidian cons:**\n\n- Can be very complicated to set up extra features\n\n\n[Obsidian](https://zapier.com/blog/obsidian-notes/) brings a unique open-endedness, inviting you to customize it with dozens of plugins. At heart, Obsidian is a note-taking tool with a graph view, allowing you to see your ideas in a constellation. Most of the advanced features and plugins are turned off by default, but going to the settings menu will give you a long list to play around with. And while you can do a lot already with these first-party plugins (such as enabling a slash command menu), the community plugins allow you to add extra functionality to the app itself.\n\nThe most exciting part of this app is that you can transform it to suit your needs. Depending on your technical knowledge (or fearlessness), you can set up Kanban boards, calendars, and to-do lists; configure a spaced repetition system; and even add sketches to your notes. This isn't even the full list; there's a lot more to discover.\n\nAll your documents live inside a \"vault.\" Since everything is stored locally—in a folder on your computer as Markdown files—your data is always yours. If you want to sync your data to the cloud, you can upload this folder to your file storage app of choice.\n\nCollaborating with others requires some acrobatics, at least while the Obsidian team builds those features into the app. The easiest way is to create a vault, upload it to Google Drive, and share it with your team. Other methods include (brace yourself) setting up a free-tier server on a cloud hosting provider and connecting a live editing plugin.\n\nIs there all-in-one potential in Obsidian? Absolutely. Will it require you to learn as you go and invest a lot of time and patience? Yes, it will. And the end result might be a tool perfectly tuned to the way you gather, think about, and communicate information. High investment, high reward.\n\n**Obsidian pricing:** Free for personal use. Sync add-on enables cross-device syncing for $5/month. Publish add-on lets you create a site for your notes for $10/site/month. Commercial licenses available at $50/user/month.\n\n**Read more:** [Obsidian vs. Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/obsidian-vs-notion/)\n\n## Can Notion be beaten?\n\nThis category of Notion alternatives includes all sorts of approaches and features—some solutions start with entirely different mindsets. Most of the platforms on this list are either free or have a free plan to help you evaluate the features on offer, so take your time to experiment and see which one matches best with what you need. And hey, maybe Notion is the app for you after all.\n\n**Related reading:**\n\n- [Build a second brain in Notion (with template)](https://zapier.com/blog/second-brain-notion-template/)\n\n- Notion comparisons: [Notion vs. Roam](https://zapier.com/blog/roam-vs-notion), [Notion vs. OneNote](https://zapier.com/blog/notion-vs-onenote/), [Notion vs. Evernote](https://zapier.com/blog/notion-vs-evernote/), [Craft vs. Notion](https://zapier.com/blog/craft-vs-notion/)\n\n- [How to use Notion AI](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-use-notion-ai)\n\n- [The best AI notes apps](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-notes-apps)\n\n\n_This article was originally published in April 2022.

People use it for project management, task management, note-taking, or creating a knowledge base.\n\nHowever, there are many productivity tools out there that also offer great value for individuals and businesses. **When putting together my list of best Notion alternatives, I considered numerous factors**:\n\n**Features:** I collected those alternatives that offer similar features to Notion. Also, I categorized them based on their main strengths, for example, the best Notion alternative for note-taking or the best Notion alternative for project management. This way, you can differentiate more easily which one is better for you.\n\n**Pricing**: My goal was to find Notion alternatives for a reasonable price.

It has quite similar features for note-taking. However, it has more advanced project management features, and it is a more user-friendly app than Notion, with a shorter learning curve.\n\n#### **Key features**\n\n![Coda project management tools](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Coda-project-management-tools.webp?resize=1020%2C458&ssl=1)\n\n**Note-taking tools:** Writing notes works similarly to Notion. It uses blocks to structure your content. You can use different paragraph styles, add quotes, callouts, and more. If you click on the “/” tab, you can create blocks. When creating them, you can choose from many formats, from templates, text, tables, images, calendars, and so on.\n\n**Project management tools:** During my Coda review, I discovered that this tool makes it easy for people to get the information they need quickly, as it has advanced visualization features. Coda offers numerous view options that help to visualize dependencies, making the project planning and tracking much smoother. For example, it has tables, grids, boards, calendars, Gantt charts, and many other views.It is very easy to create customized dashboards and apply filters.\n\n**Task management tools:** You can add different columns for each task. When adding columns, you can change their types, which is great because it makes filling in data easier. When considering what type you want to add, there is a full list from which you can choose. You can insert text, dates, checkboxes, links, files, assignees, and many other elements.\n\n**Templates:** Coda’s Gallery includes many templates for project management, meetings, knowledge management, project briefs, OKRs, and more. Templates are great for creating documents and projects faster.\n\n**Automation tools:** Coda’s automation has two steps: When and Then. However, you can also add the “If” condition to your rules. You can easily create automation with Coda and streamline many workflows.\n\n**Collaboration features:** Coda has a wide range of real-time collaboration features. You can edit text in real-time, mention and tag others, or assign tasks to your team members. You can share documents easily with your team members with a click, so you can be on the same page. It offers tools for permission management and workflow automation, helping to make your team’s collaboration smoother.\n\n**AI tools:** Similarly to Notion AI, it has an AI assistant that helps you in many ways when taking notes. For instance, it can summarize, translate, answer questions, or help you brainstorm an idea or convert it into a table. The use cases of Coda AI are almost endless. As you use Coda along the way, you will implement it in more workflows than you think.\n\n**Integrations:** You can connect Coda with multiple third-party apps, including Zapier. Thanks to the Zapier integrations, Coda supports integrations with more than 7,000 third-party apps.\n\n**Mobile app:** Coda has a mobile version as well. It is not as versatile as the desktop version and has fewer features, but you can use it to track your projects and tasks and read your notes.\n\n#### **Pricing structure**\n\n![Coda pricing](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Coda-pricing.webp?resize=1020%2C431&ssl=1)\n\nCoda offers four pricing plans.\n\nThe **free plan** has essential features like unlimited doc size for unshared docs, collaborative docs, tables, charts, kanban boards, forms, and automation. The free version is ideal for individuals or teams that want to test whether Coda suits the whole team.\n\nThe **Pro plan is $10** per month and is ideal for small businesses or individuals who need advanced features. This plan includes a 30-day version history, hidden pages, custom domains, brandings, icons, and AI credits as well.\n\nIf you want unlimited automation, version history, and AI credits, you need to go for the **Team plan, which is $30 per month.** This plan is great for small and large teams as well. Using Coda’s Team plan, you will access the folder access, which can be crucial for teams.\n\nLastly, Coda offers an **Enterprise plan** for large businesses. It is $60 per month, and you will have access to advanced security features and a dedicated customer success manager.\n\n[Best 5 Notion Alternatives To EXPLODE Your Productivity In 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZQ4sKd9C44&list=PLrRm3Kq-V4MfL_nmxAgr29g8QYrsHkTjo&index=3&ab_channel=Thebusinessdive \"Play video \\\"Best 5 Notion Alternatives To EXPLODE Your Productivity In 2025\\\"\")\n\nIn this video, I show you the best 5 Notion alternatives.\n\n#### **Coda’s user interface**\n\n![Coda user interface](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Coda-user-interface.webp?resize=1020%2C461&ssl=1)\n\nCoda is a **beautiful and simple** productivity app. Personally, I experienced a short learning curve, and it was easy to navigate through its features.\n\nWhile Coda is a simple app, it has the depth to manage documents and projects in more detail. So, it will take some time to learn all the features. Nevertheless, it has some tutorials and guides, so you will quickly master Coda.\n\n#### **My experience with Coda**\n\n**It was a surprise to me, especially its project management features.** Its ease of use, wide range of display options, and customization possibilities make Coda a perfect choice.\n\nCoda blends documents, spreadsheets, and apps into a single flexible workspace known for powerful formulas and automation features.\n\nIt has many templates for specific use cases, so you can speed up the document creation process. Also, I appreciated that it has powerful note-taking capabilities.\n\nDuring my Coda.io review, I discovered that Coda is a powerful alternative for building custom apps, with robust database and formula capabilities.\n\nI had only two issues with Coda. First, it does not have a desktop app you can access even without an internet connection. Secondly, the Enterprise plan is quite pricey.\n\nOverall, my experience with Coda was 10/10, and I highly recommend it to individuals and small teams.\n\n#### **Coda’s pros and cons**\n\n![Pros and cons of Coda](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Pros-and-cons-of-Coda-1.webp?resize=1020%2C765&ssl=1)\n\n#### **Why is it the best Notion alternative overall?**\n\nIf you are looking for a tool that is very similar to Notion, with a more user-friendly user interface and a shorter learning curve, even for your team, Coda is a perfect choice. Its feature set and advanced project management tools make Coda a great Notion alternative.\n\nYou can read the full review here: [My Honest Coda.io Review: Here’s What Surprised Me!

People refer to Xtiles as the baby of Notion and Miro, and it is somehow true.\n\nXtiles allows users to build dashboards using visual tiles, making it a more aesthetically pleasing option. With Xtiles, you can access your notes offline as well. You can use this note-taking app for personal or business purposes.\n\n#### **Key features**\n\n![Xtiles' projects feature](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n**Note-taking tools:** The visual boards include tiles, which are the elements on a page to display and organize information. It has a super-easy drag-and-drop interface, so you can create a tile of any size if you click on the canvas. You can add different types of content with Xtiles, such as text, lists, tables, images, videos, code, etc. Unlike most note-taking apps, where you can only drag and drop elements after each other, the tiles give you way more customization options, as you can select the exact size and position of the tiles.

However, there are templates for productivity, education, brainstorming, teams, and meetings.

(2025)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIQoFvRVOWI&list=PLrRm3Kq-V4MfL_nmxAgr29g8QYrsHkTjo&index=1&ab_channel=Thebusinessdive \"Play video \\\"Notion Vs Xtiles | Which Productivity App Is Better? (2025)\\\"\")\n\nIn this video, I show the key differences between Notion and Xtiles.\n\n#### **Pricing structure**\n\n![Xtiles pricing](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Xtiles-pricing-1.webp?resize=1022%2C523&ssl=1)\n\nXtiles has three plans.\n\nThefree plan includes unlimited blocks, projects, 100+ free templates, one workspace to share, three personal workspaces, unlimited storage (5MB/file), and five pages per project. The free plan is **ideal for individuals, mainly for personal use**.\n\nThe **starter plan** is $5 per month per user. Besides the features included in the free plan, it offers unlimited personal spaces, pages, premium templates, unlimited storage, recurring tasks features, and Google Calendar integration. The starter plan is **ideal for individuals who use Xtiles for daily work and need more powerful capabilities** to enhance their note-taking experience.\n\nLastly, Xtiles offers the **plus plan** for $8.25 per month per user. This plan includes everything in the starter plan. In addition to those features, it provides color customization, timeline view, priority support, forms, unlimited shared spaces, linked pages, and productivity bundles.

Compared to Notion’s massive and slightly conservative user interface, it is user-friendly. It is a very simple app, so you can easily navigate and utilize its full capabilities with a short learning curve.\n\nOverall, Xtiles offers a pleasant experience with its intuitive user interface.\n\n#### **My experience with Xtiles**\n\nThe other main difference between Notion and Xtiles is the user interface and learning curve. Xtiles is a visually appealing app that offers many ways to visually organize your notes. But most importantly, it is a very simple app with a short learning curve.\n\nOn the other hand, Notion has a quite massive and slightly old-fashioned user interface with a way longer learning curve to explore and learn all its features.\n\n#### **Xtiles’s pros and cons**\n\n![Pros and cons of Xtiles](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pros-and-cons-of-Xtiles-1.webp?resize=1020%2C765&ssl=1)\n\n#### **Why is it the best Notion alternative for visual note-taking?**\n\nXtiles is a simple but effective Notion alternative for note-taking and even project management.

It combines project management, task tracking, documentation, and built-in version control—so teams can plan work, track issues, and collaborate without switching tools.\n\nBacklog is especially appealing for developers because it integrates Git, SVN, and issue tracking in a single platform. Plus, its flat, no-per-user pricing makes it a budget-friendly option as your team grows.\n\n#### **Key features**\n\n![Backlog's key features](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n**Project management tools:** Backlog gives you multiple ways to visualize and track work. You can use Gantt charts, Kanban-style Boards, and detailed Issue views to monitor progress and spot bottlenecks early. Filters help you drill down into specific projects, assignees, and task types, making it easy to stay focused.\n\n**Task management features:** In Backlog, all work items are created as “issues,” which can represent tasks, bug reports, requests, or custom workflows. Each issue supports priority, assignee, due date, category, estimated hours, file attachments, and more. This makes Backlog much more structured than Notion’s lightweight task databases.\n\n**Tools for developers:** Backlog shines for engineering teams. It centralizes Git and SVN repositories alongside issues, enabling developers to link commits, pull requests, and code reviews directly to the work they’re completing. The Issues tab also makes it simple to review open bugs, tasks, and requests in one place.\n\n**Dashboard:** Backlog’s dashboard provides a snapshot of everything happening across projects. If you open a specific project’s Home tab, you’ll get a detailed view of tasks, progress charts, and recent updates.\n\n**Team collaboration tools:** You can comment on issues, mention teammates, and track conversations as work progresses. Backlog’s Wiki adds an internal knowledge-base for guides, processes, troubleshooting steps, or dev documentation. Teams can structure pages easily and include images, links, and code.\n\n**File management:** Each project includes its own file storage area. You can upload files, organize them into folders, and share direct links to items when needed. Designers, developers, and project managers can keep important assets tied to the work they belong to.\n\n**Documents:** Backlog’s Documents feature works similarly to Notion’s page editor. It uses a flexible block-based interface for text, images, tables, and subpages—making it easy to take notes, create pages, document processes, or build an internal knowledge center. For teams who love Notion’s structure but need deeper project and issue tracking, this strikes a great balance.\n\n**Integrations:** You can connect Backlog with Slack, Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, and other tools commonly used in development workflows.\n\n**Mobile app:** Backlog’s mobile apps for iOS and Android let you check tasks, respond to comments, and stay on top of project updates when you’re away from your desk.\n\n#### **Pricing structure**\n\n![Backlog pricing plans](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nBacklog offers one free plan and four paid plans—each with flat pricing rather than charging per user.\n\n- **Free Plan:** Up to 10 users, 1 project, and limited storage. Enough for small teams testing the app.\n- **Starter Plan ($35/month):** Up to 30 users, 5 projects, 1GB storage, and subtasking.\n- **Standard Plan ($100/month):** No user limit, 100 projects, 30GB storage, Gantt/Burndown charts, and issue templates.\n- **Premium Plan ($175/month):** No user limit, unlimited projects, 100GB storage, and advanced features.\n- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for organizations needing advanced security and administration.\n\n\n#### **Backlog’s user interface**\n\n![Backlog's user interface](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nBacklog’s UI is clean, logical, and easy to navigate. Features are clearly organized, and the platform doesn’t overwhelm you with options. Even users unfamiliar with developer tools can get up to speed quickly.\n\n#### **My experience with Backlog**\n\nAfter using Backlog for several weeks, I found it surprisingly adaptable—even for non-technical work. While developer-focused features like Git and bug tracking may be more meaningful to engineering teams, Backlog’s project organization and documentation tools make it valuable for a wide range of businesses.\n\nOverall, it delivers a smooth experience and keeps projects structured without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n#### **Backlog’s pros and cons**\n\n![Pros and Cons of Backlog compared to Notion](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n#### **Why is it the best Notion alternative for developer teams?**\n\nBacklog brings together documentation, task management, and software development tools in one place—making it a powerful Notion alternative for engineering and product teams.\n\nIt’s simple to use, designed for collaboration, and its flat pricing makes it an especially cost-effective solution for growing organizations.\n\n[Try Backlog](https://nulab.com/backlog/?ref=m2vimzg&utm_source=tapfiliate&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=CPA&utm_term=m2vimzg)\n\n### Taskade\n\n**Best Notion alternative for task management**\n\n![Taskade review](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Taskade-review-1.webp?resize=1020%2C493&ssl=1)\n\n[Taskade](https://taskade.com/?via=v2jxf) is also a fantastic Notion alternative. While its note-taking capabilities are more limited compared to Notion, it has more solid features for automating your workflows, projects, and task management.\n\n#### **Key features**\n\n![Taskade task management features](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Taskade-task-management-features.webp?resize=1024%2C452&ssl=1)\n\n**Note-taking tools:** Taskade can also work as a note-taking app. Nevertheless, compared to note-taking apps like Notion, Obsidian, Anytype, or Xtiles, Taskade lacks advanced note-taking capabilities. It misses some crucial features like backlinks, database creation, note organization features, etc. But to be honest, Taskade was simply not designed for these workflows. Taskade uses a task-based approach, so everything you write in Taskade can be transformed into tasks, and you can connect them to your projects or automate them.\n\n**Project management tools:** This is lightweight project management software. I say it is a lightweight project management app because it lacks advanced features, such as time tracking. Also, it is not as complex as ClickUp’s project management app. However, it has many valuable features like numerous view options, advanced automation, and many other tools to enhance project management.\n\n**Task management tools:** Taskade is a task management software that allows you to manage multiple projects and tasks effectively. When I said that Taskade is a lightweight project management app, it is not true for task management, as it has solid features. You can easily add and assign tasks to your team members. With one click, you can create task lists and give due dates, tags, and notes to each task.\n\n**Templates:** Taskade offers numerous templates for task management, project management, mind maps, team management, etc. They can save you massive time, as you no longer need to start from scratch when creating a new project.\n\n**Automation tools:** Taskade’s automation allows you to streamline repetitive tasks by setting up triggers and actions. You can design custom workflows and integrate them with Google Sheets, Slack, or WordPress.\n\n**Collaboration features:** Taskade offers a shared space for teams to communicate, collaborate, and manage their projects. This app is full of collaboration features. You can easily share your workspaces and projects with your team members. In your projects, Taskade has a built-in chat feature that allows you to communicate with your team members. Also, Taskade has robust features when it comes to real-time collaboration. You can assign tasks to your team members, edit your projects together, and create a knowledge management center for your company.\n\n**AI tools:** This tool is one of the most solid Notion alternatives when it comes to AI capabilities. Taskade has a common AI assistant that helps you pull out information, summarize documents, and so on. Nevertheless, it has a unique AI tool called AI agents, which is Taskade’s standout feature. They are useful for collecting information, helping you to brainstorm, delegating tasks, and ultimately improving productivity. You can tailor your AI agents to your specific needs by providing them with sources, commands, and instructions.\n\n**Integrations:** During my Taskade review, I discovered that it offers a wide range of seamless integrations. You can connect Taskade with Zapier, which allows you to integrate Taskade with more than 7000 third-party apps. Furthermore, you can use automation with many popular apps like Gmail, Slack, Google Forms, WordPress, MailChimp, Webflow, Calendly, and more.\n\n**Mobile app:** Taskade has a mobile version for iOS and Android as well. The mobile app works really great compared to many Notion alternatives.\n\n[Notion vs Taskade: Which is the BEST in 2025?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uM61fAjrKM&list=PLrRm3Kq-V4MfL_nmxAgr29g8QYrsHkTjo&index=2&ab_channel=Thebusinessdive \"Play video \\\"Notion vs Taskade: Which is the BEST in 2025?\\\"\")\n\nHere, I show you the key differences between Notion and Taskade.\n\n#### **Pricing structure**\n\n![Taskade pricing](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nTaskade offers three plans.\n\nThe free plan includes one AI agent, one workspace, all the views except the Gantt Chart, and five AI requests per day. **This plan is ideal for individuals who only utilize Taskade for personal use** or just want to give it a try.\n\nThe **Taskade Pro is best suited for professionals and small teams** that use Taskade daily. It has everything from the free plan to more. The Taskade Pro covers unlimited AI requests, custom AI agents, unlimited file upload, Gantt view, integrations, and more.\n\nIf you want to use all the features, go with the Teams plan. **It is also ideal for bigger teams and individuals who want to use Taskade without limits**. The Teams plan includes multi-agent teams, unlimited workspaces, AI automation, version history, and share and embed functions.\n\nConsidering the pricing of other project management apps or AI-powered productivity tools, Taskade’s pricing seems reasonable.\n\n#### **Taskase’s user interface**\n\n![Taskade user interface](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Taskade-user-interface-1.webp?resize=1020%2C473&ssl=1)\n\nTaskade has a **user-friendly and intuitive interface with a beautiful design**. Also, it has quite a short learning curve, and you can quickly learn to utilize almost all the features.\n\nI also enjoyed the way Taskade structures its pages and functions. Essentially, you can find almost all the features on the page you are working on. So, you can access the team chat, AI features, different views, and other projects on the same page without feeling that it is packed.\n\n#### **My experience with Taskade**\n\nI had a great experience with Taskade, and I think it is the best Notion alternative for task management and automation. I was skeptical of the AI features, but they proved me wrong. Taskade also has great real-time collaboration tools, and I especially enjoyed the chat feature.\n\nTo wrap it up, Taskade is a feature-rich Notion alternative. However, unlike Notion, Taskade has a pinpoint focus on task management, and not note-taking.\n\n#### **Taskade’s pros and cons**\n\n![Pros and Cons of Taskade](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Pros-and-Cons-of-Taskade-1.webp?resize=1022%2C766&ssl=1)\n\n#### **Why is it the best Notion alternative for task management?**\n\nTaskade is a solid Notion alternative for tasks and even project management, thanks to its advanced workflow automation and collaboration features. It is also worth mentioning that it has fantastic AI features.\n\nYou can read the full review here: [Taskade Review: Features, Pricing, Pros & Cons (2025)](https://thebusinessdive.com/taskade-review)\n\n[Try Taskade](https://taskade.com/?via=v2jxf)\n\n### ClickUp\n\n**Best Notion alternative for project management**\n\n![ClickUp is one the best Notion alternatives for project management](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ClickUp-is-one-the-best-Notion-alternatives-for-project-management-1.webp?resize=1020%2C471&ssl=1)\n\n[ClickUp](https://try.web.clickup.com/thebusinessdive) is one of the best Notion alternatives for project management.

It worked smoothly on my mobile.\n\n#### **Pricing structure**\n\n![Anytype pricing](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nAnytype offers four plans.\n\n**The free plan includes 1 GB of network space, three shared spaces, and three space members per shared space**. Using the free plan, you can sync your devices, get backup storage, and even collaborate in small groups. During my Anytype review, I also used the free plan, and I think it is ideal for your personal notes.\n\nThe builder plan provides a unique name for you: **128 GB of network space, three shared spaces, 10 Editors per shared space, unlimited viewers per shared space, and priority support**. This plan works great for small teams.\n\nThe co-creator plan is quite similar to the builder plan. However, this plan offers **256 GB of network space** and a shorter unique name. This plan is ideal for teams.\n\nLastly, Anytype **offers business plans upon request**, where you have the option to determine the size of the network space, number of editors, or shared spaces, and gives unlimited Viewers per shared space. This plan could be fit for bigger teams.\n\n#### **Anytype’s user interface**\n\n![Anytype review - objects](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anytype-review-objects.webp?resize=1020%2C462&ssl=1)\n\nWhile the way Anytype works might seem complex, it has a **simple and intuitive user interface**. On the left side, you can access everything you need, from spaces, widgets, libraries, and bins. Anytype’s user interface is optimized for mobile users as well.\n\n#### **My experience with Anytype**\n\nI am not going to lie; Anytype is a complex app. It took time to learn and use properly, and I needed to watch some YouTube videos as well, and read many guides. Anytype features an object-based approach to note-taking, and while it offers real-time collaboration, it is currently better for personal use.\n\nHowever, it is one of the best Notion alternatives since it offers a safe place where you can take notes. Anytype implements a decentralized model that emphasizes privacy and security, which makes it one of the most privacy-focused note-taking apps.\n\nLastly, it has more advanced features for managing and organizing your notes than Notion and most of the note-taking apps.\n\n#### **Anytype’s pros and cons**\n\n![Anytype pros and cons ](https://i0.wp.com/thebusinessdive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anytype-pros-and-cons-1.webp?resize=1020%2C765&ssl=1)\n\n#### **Why is it the best Notion alternative for safe note-taking?**\n\n[Notion vs Anytype: 5 CRUCIAL Differences I Found Over 2+ Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTbDEbOOj3g&list=PLrRm3Kq-V4MfL_nmxAgr29g8QYrsHkTjo&ab_channel=Thebusinessdive \"Play video \\\"Notion vs Anytype: 5 CRUCIAL Differences I Found Over 2+ Years\\\"\")\n\nHere, I compare Anytype with Notion based on features, pricing, pros & cons.\n\nAnytype is currently the safest note-taking app on the market, and it has an extensive free plan that is sufficient for individuals. With this note-taking app, you can store all your data in a safe place, and it provides almost infinite options for data organization.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, Anytype is the best free Notion alternative for individuals who need a safe note-taking app.\n\nYou can read the full review here: [Anytype Review: The Best Note-Taking App In 2025?](https://thebusinessdive.com/anytype-review)\n\n[Try Anytype](https://anytype.io/)\n\n## Summary: Best Notion alternatives in 2025\n\nNotion is a fantastic productivity tool overall, and it is hard to beat.

It provides journal pages for quick capturing of daily tasks.\n- [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/): Airtable is often compared to a powerful spreadsheet, excellent for users needing robust database and visualization features.\n- [Trello](https://trello.com/): Trello is best for teams who prefer a simple, straightforward Kanban board for visual task management, and don’t need advanced project management tools.\n- [Monday.com](https://thebusinessdive.com/monday-review): Monday.com focuses on visual project tracking, work management, and automation, making progress easy to see.\n- [Asana](https://thebusinessdive.com/asana-review): Personally, it’s not my favorite, but Asana is a popular choice for managing large-scale projects with features for multiple project views.\n- [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence): Confluence is designed to be a collaborative workspace for teams, ideal for wikis and technical documentation within the Atlassian ecosystem.\n- [Evernote](https://thebusinessdive.com/evernote-review): Evernote offers powerful search functionality, easy organization via notebooks and tags, and reliable cross-platform syncing. Although it is extremely expensive, it is an okay Notion alternative for note-taking.\n- [Slite](https://slite.com/): Slite is strong for teams needing to build an internal wiki, focusing on knowledge management and collaboration.\n\n### Is there anything better than Notion?\n\nNotion has undoubtedly become one of the most popular productivity tools. However, there are some solid Notion alternatives that have similar features with even more advanced features. For me, the best overall Notion alternative is Coda.\n\nRelated article:\n\n- [7 Best Note-Taking Apps For 2025 \\| +2 Years Personal Testing](https://thebusinessdive.com/best-note-taking-apps)\n\n### What is better, Notion or Xtiles?\n\nBoth Notion and Xtiles are great productivity tools. Xtiles is ideal for people who need a **simple note-taking tool that offers a visual representation**. It is a powerful tool for creating visually engaging content, whether it is about project management or complex workflows. Although it does not have as many collaboration features as Notion, Xtiles is a cost-effective solution for teams.\n\nIf you are looking for a **more versatile app that you can use for note-taking, project, task, and database management**, Notion is a better alternative. It has a minimalist design with robust collaboration features.\n\nRelating article: [Xtiles Vs Notion: All Features Compared (2025)](https://thebusinessdive.com/xtiles-vs-notion)\n\n### Is Obsidian better than Notion?\n\nOverall, Obsidian is a more powerful app than Notion for personal note-taking. While it is a complex app with a long learning curve, it offers many possibilities to organize your notes and brainstorm ideas. And most importantly, you can do it safely.\n\nNonetheless, if you are looking for an app for note-taking, project, task management, or team collaboration, Notion is a way better tool than Obsidian. Obsidian is simply not ideal for team collaboration or managing projects within a team.\n\nRelating article: [Notion Vs Obsidian: Side-by-Side Comparison (2025)](https://thebusinessdive.com/notion-vs-obsidian)\n\n### Does Notion or Coda have better project management tools?\n\nIf we consider the project management features, Coda is a more powerful productivity tool. It offers more views, customization, and automation features than Notion.\n\nRelating article: [Notion Vs Coda: Side-by-Side Comparison (2025)](https://thebusinessdive.com/notion-vs-coda)\n\n_Disclosure: I only recommend products I would use myself, and all opinions expressed here are our own.

It is not for me. I struggle a lot with Notion because there is so much you can do with it. There are also other aspects of Notion I dislike not because Notion is a bad product, because it is not. It is one of the best products out there. I dislike Notion simply because it does not fit my brain and the way I work. It does not fit me and my needs. You might feel the same way, or you might just be looking for another option. In this article, that is exactly what I am going to try to provide: some good alternatives to Notion.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*FWJiK6KEV-lNzM4frn08Mw.png)\n\n### [Affine](https://affine.pro/)\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*flfbxFK0T-y1_kkyu0tkAQ.png)\n\nFrom Affine website\n\nAffine is not only open source but also one of the most interesting options I have seen in the productivity space. It has a visual aspect that few other apps on this list have. It has whiteboards that work with the pages, so a change you make in the whiteboard is reflected on the page and vice versa. It is so smart and something I have not seen any other apps do. Affine has databases just like Notion, and that is important because that is the main selling point for something like Notion.

Geez. TY for showing legit alternatives that work great for ppl. Coda, Anytype, amplenote, affine, craft, capacities, tana, etc etc. Can be perfectly capable platforms. Notion is slow & clunky, especially when DBs get bigger and bigger. The more marketing, the more attention. The more attention, the more partnerships w other APIs.

Everytime . For many reasons . Now even better now than when this video was made. I like capacities and craft too . Still using them ‘to keep my eye in’ . Because of the graph and flow views it would take a lot for me to move away from it . I have hundreds of objects in Anytype. I find obsidian not as effective for my specific use case. Anytype almost works like a mind mapper for me .

video is likely going to be a\n\n0:02\n\n\ncontroversial one and that's because\n\n0:04\n\n\nwe're going to be talking about notion\n\n0:06\n\n\nAlternatives and as many of you know\n\n0:08\n\n\nthere are lots of different notion\n\n0:10\n\n\nalternatives on the market but it's very\n\n0:12\n\n\ndifficult to judge which one's right for\n\n0:14\n\n\nyou so we're going to help you find the\n\n0:16\n\n\nright notion alternative if you're\n\n0:18\n\n\nlooking for it for personal use and\n\n0:20\n\n\nwe'll dig into why I'd recommend going\n\n0:23\n\n\nfor those different apps in this video\n\n0:25\n\n\nWelcome everyone my name is Franchesco\n\n0:27\n\n\ndelesio and welcome to tool finder if\n\n0:29\n\n\nyou're new here do subscribe and if\n\n0:31\n\n\nyou're looking for a note taking\n\n0:32\n\n\napplication you might as well get our\n\n0:34\n\n\nbuyer guide to notet taking apps it'll\n\n0:37\n\n\nhelp you with insight and knowledge\n\n0:39\n\n\nabout how to pick the best notet taking\n\n0:41\n\n\napp and you'll find that linked Below in\n\n0:43\n\n\nthe description but without further Ado\n\n0:45\n\n\nlet's dive into this video so this is a\n\n0:47\n\n\nreally difficult video to make because\n\n0:49\n\n\nnotion is such a well-built application\n\n0:52\n\n\nit's an app that has so much going for\n\n0:54\n\n\nit in terms of its abilities so it's\n\n0:56\n\n\nactually very hard to find something\n\n0:58\n\n\nlike for like as an alternative and\n\n1:00\n\n\nthat's because notion has built\n\n1:01\n\n\ndatabases it's build a fully flexible\n\n1:04\n\n\ndocument management system which allows\n\n1:06\n\n\nyou to build whatever you want and it's\n\n1:08\n\n\nalso got an amazing Community behind it\n\n1:11\n\n\nwhich also makes it difficult because\n\n1:12\n\n\nthere's so much resources already there\n\n1:14\n\n\nto learn it so we're going to be taking\n\n1:17\n\n\nthat in mind as we look at these\n\n1:18\n\n\nAlternatives and for our first\n\n1:20\n\n\nalternative this is any type now I've\n\n1:23\n\n\nbeen talking about any type for some\n\n1:25\n\n\ntime now it's a note taking application\n\n1:27\n\n\nthat uses something called object based\n\n1:29\n\n\nnot taking and that concept sounds\n\n1:31\n\n\npretty crazy but you know when you use\n\n1:33\n\n\nyour notion account everything gets\n\n1:35\n\n\ncreated as a page and of course in that\n\n1:38\n\n\npage there are blocks the same concept\n\n1:40\n\n\ngoes with any type when you create a\n\n1:42\n\n\npage there are blocks but a page isn't\n\n1:45\n\n\njust a page it's a template an object if\n\n1:48\n\n\nyou like that allows you to build from\n\n1:50\n\n\nthat each time and each of these\n\n1:52\n\n\ntemplates or objects are built\n\n1:54\n\n\ncompletely differently so for example\n\n1:55\n\n\nyou could link it to a person or a\n\n1:58\n\n\nmeeting or a simple note all the way to\n\n2:01\n\n\nmanaging a task in a project but the\n\n2:03\n\n\nidea behind this is the object is a way\n\n2:06\n\n\nto structure the note that you take now\n\n2:09\n\n\nthat's not only the reason a lot of\n\n2:10\n\n\npeople like any type it has some\n\n2:12\n\n\npowerful features in terms of getting\n\n2:14\n\n\nthings started with your note taking for\n\n2:16\n\n\nexample a graph view a flow View and\n\n2:19\n\n\nalso other views that are going to help\n\n2:21\n\n\nyou to manage your notes more\n\n2:22\n\n\neffectively including ones like sets\n\n2:25\n\n\nwhich help you to organize all of your\n\n2:27\n\n\nideas and thoughts and notes into these\n\n2:29\n\n\ndifferent structures much like you would\n\n2:32\n\n\nin notion databases the other kicker to\n\n2:34\n\n\nthis application is that it's local\n\n2:36\n\n\nfirst it's offline and it also uses\n\n2:39\n\n\nendtoend security when uploading your\n\n2:42\n\n\nnotes to the cloud which means that you\n\n2:44\n\n\nhave that protection that you don't get\n\n2:46\n\n\ninside of apps like notion so at the\n\n2:48\n\n\nsame time it's really focused on the\n\n2:50\n\n\nsecurity and privacy aspect that seems\n\n2:52\n\n\nto be baked into their whole company\n\n2:54\n\n\nethos which is slightly different to\n\n2:56\n\n\nnotion which is much more widely\n\n2:57\n\n\navailable and doesn't have those\n\n2:59\n\n\nabilities than I know of at least next\n\n3:01\n\n\non our list is one called capacities now\n\n3:03\n\n\nif you like notion then you're probably\n\n3:05\n\n\ngoing to like capacities because it\n\n3:07\n\n\nlooks very similar the applications are\n\n3:09\n\n\nvery beautiful and easy to use but\n\n3:11\n\n\ncapacities is probably very strictly for\n\n3:14\n\n\nnote taking and much like any type has\n\n3:16\n\n\nsomething called object based note\n\n3:17\n\n\ntaking which allows you to create\n\n3:19\n\n\nobjects as you get started now obviously\n\n3:21\n\n\nwe talked about the benefits of that it\n\n3:23\n\n\ncan save a bunch of time in the future\n\n3:25\n\n\nwhen building out your account and\n\n3:26\n\n\nlinking things up and using things like\n\n3:28\n\n\nPKM personal Knowledge Management and\n\n3:31\n\n\nnetwork thought can be incredibly\n\n3:33\n\n\nvaluable using apps like capacities in\n\n3:35\n\n\nany type but there are a few abilities\n\n3:37\n\n\ninside this app that are pretty neat and\n\n3:39\n\n\nI want to focus on two of them the first\n\n3:41\n\n\nof those is a calendar view which allows\n\n3:43\n\n\nyou to do daily notes now this is great\n\n3:45\n\n\nfor planning tasks ahead but it also is\n\n3:48\n\n\ngreat for using as your journal and the\n\n3:50\n\n\ninterface is really nice for this\n\n3:51\n\n\nallowing you to see what you created on\n\n3:53\n\n\nthat day and Skip ahead to what is\n\n3:55\n\n\nplanned in the future but what I also\n\n3:57\n\n\nlike is their feature called AI chat and\n\n3:59\n\n\nsome of this is locked under the premium\n\n4:01\n\n\nbut you can plug in your open AI key and\n\n4:04\n\n\nhave conversations about your notes\n\n4:05\n\n\nadding the object as the premise and\n\n4:08\n\n\nallowing you to spend on those different\n\n4:10\n\n\nobjects or notes that you've created in\n\n4:12\n\n\nyour account which I quite like you can\n\n4:14\n\n\nsave your AI chats as part of your\n\n4:16\n\n\nexperience and I find that to be a\n\n4:18\n\n\nlittle bit better structure than what\n\n4:20\n\n\nnotion has in its artificial\n\n4:21\n\n\nintelligence at the moment so next up is\n\n4:24\n\n\none called craft now this is great if\n\n4:26\n\n\nyou're a team but it also can be good as\n\n4:27\n\n\nan individual craft is a really\n\n4:29\n\n\nbeautiful documents based app and it\n\n4:31\n\n\ndoesn't have those powerful database\n\n4:33\n\n\nabilities but it is looking into the\n\n4:35\n\n\nobject based note taking which I\n\n4:36\n\n\nmentioned at the start of this video but\n\n4:38\n\n\ngraft as a whole will help you to create\n\n4:40\n\n\ndocuments it allow you to share them and\n\n4:43\n\n\ncreate basic structures but more\n\n4:44\n\n\nrecently they've been adding abilities\n\n4:46\n\n\nlike whiteboards that are going to help\n\n4:48\n\n\nyou to visualize your ideas much more\n\n4:50\n\n\neffectively and I think some of the\n\n4:52\n\n\nabilities and craft when it comes to\n\n4:55\n\n\ncreating a beautiful document are much\n\n4:57\n\n\nbetter than you get a notion and I want\n\n4:59\n\n\nto pay pay particular attention to\n\n5:01\n\n\nsomething called cards inside a craft\n\n5:02\n\n\nwhich you can create and build inside of\n\n5:05\n\n\nany page that you make and these\n\n5:07\n\n\nbeautiful cards are basically like tiles\n\n5:10\n\n\ninside of your account and they can be\n\n5:12\n\n\ncustomized and modified in the premium\n\n5:14\n\n\nversion and allow you to do much more\n\n5:15\n\n\nthe negative craft is unlike notion you\n\n5:18\n\n\ndon't get free access with unlimited\n\n5:20\n\n\nblocks you only get 10 documents to\n\n5:22\n\n\nstart out with and two every single week\n\n5:24\n\n\nthat you use it which can be incredibly\n\n5:26\n\n\nlimiting over time so it's well worth\n\n5:29\n\n\nlooking to the premium pricing if you're\n\n5:30\n\n\nlooking at craft as an option those\n\n5:33\n\n\nwhiteboards and those page like Builder\n\n5:35\n\n\nabilities are definitely the killer\n\n5:37\n\n\nfeatures in craft but it won't replace\n\n5:38\n\n\nthe databases that you typically get\n\n5:40\n\n\ninside of notion now next up is one\n\n5:42\n\n\ncalled Apen Pro now I've reviewed it\n\n5:44\n\n\nhere on the channel and what I quite\n\n5:46\n\n\nliked about it is that you can create a\n\n5:48\n\n\nnote or a document and you can turn that\n\n5:50\n\n\ninstantly into a whiteboard experience\n\n5:52\n\n\nand it's probably the best way I've seen\n\n5:54\n\n\nthis being done on the market because it\n\n5:56\n\n\nnaturally brings those two\n\n5:58\n\n\ninterconnected and then then if for\n\n6:00\n\n\nexample you were to update the\n\n6:01\n\n\nWhiteboard or the document they\n\n6:04\n\n\nInterlink together which is very cool\n\n6:06\n\n\nmaybe I'll play that scene from Ryan re\n\n6:08\n\n\nsaying in link but it's really beautiful\n\n6:10\n\n\nin terms of how it works and operates\n\n6:12\n\n\nand I think that notion could learn a\n\n6:14\n\n\nlot from this application mainly because\n\n6:16\n\n\nwhat it does very well is it turns those\n\n6:19\n\n\ndocuments into whiteboards without\n\n6:21\n\n\nhaving to change any of the structures\n\n6:23\n\n\nin the account now this application is\n\n6:25\n\n\nin its early days and it does have a lot\n\n6:27\n\n\nof artificial intelligence features I\n\n6:29\n\n\nthink it's slightly overpriced but at\n\n6:31\n\n\nthe same time it's got some promising\n\n6:32\n\n\nideas and does have a real focus on\n\n6:35\n\n\nlocal first and security which any type\n\n6:38\n\n\nhas been really getting a lot of\n\n6:39\n\n\ntraction from so it's worth considering\n\n6:41\n\n\nif you're looking for more whiteboard\n\n6:43\n\n\nbased alternatives to notion so number\n\n6:45\n\n\nfive and what's on our list is Obsidian\n\n6:48\n\n\nand you can probably notice the trend\n\n6:50\n\n\naround all of these apps they're all\n\n6:51\n\n\nvery much notetaking Focus but of course\n\n6:54\n\n\nwe'll probably try and do another video\n\n6:55\n\n\nwhere we dive into the work based ones\n\n6:57\n\n\ncuz that's a little bit more difficult\n\n6:58\n\n\nto make but largely obsidian is probably\n\n7:01\n\n\nthe final alternative that I mentioned\n\n7:03\n\n\nand it's probably a look away from\n\n7:05\n\n\nnotion as a whole the application does a\n\n7:08\n\n\nfantastic job by building out your notes\n\n7:11\n\n\nin a PKM style so you can create network\n\n7:14\n\n\nthought and Link all these notes\n\n7:16\n\n\ntogether which makes it a beautiful\n\n7:17\n\n\napplication for turning these notes into\n\n7:20\n\n\nideas research and there's a powerful\n\n7:22\n\n\nfeature more recently added called\n\n7:24\n\n\nobsidian canvas which allows you to\n\n7:26\n\n\nconnect up these notes in a whiteboard\n\n7:29\n\n\nlike structure and the best thing about\n\n7:31\n\n\ncyan is it's free to use it's local\n\n7:34\n\n\nfirst and there is an option to sync it\n\n7:36\n\n\nas well many people do it with iCloud\n\n7:38\n\n\ndata I can't remember the name of it\n\n7:40\n\n\niCloud drive but there is a optional $4\n\n7:43\n\n\nper month service called sync which\n\n7:45\n\n\nallows you to do it with e to notes as\n\n7:47\n\n\nwell which is very helpful but largely\n\n7:49\n\n\nobsidian is really interesting bear and\n\n7:51\n\n\none of the things that I found recently\n\n7:52\n\n\nis you can actually turn on and off the\n\n7:53\n\n\ncore plugins as part of that which is\n\n7:55\n\n\nvery cool if you're looking to learn\n\n7:57\n\n\nobsidian I'd recommend checking out\n\n7:59\n\n\neffective obsidian which is a course\n\n8:01\n\n\nthat Justin D Rose works on and\n\n8:03\n\n\nnaturally you can find it in the link in\n\n8:04\n\n\ndescription if you're interested so\n\n8:06\n\n\nthose are the five Alternatives I've\n\n8:08\n\n\nlook at when looking at notion\n\n8:09\n\n\nAlternatives if you're looking for more\n\n8:11\n\n\noptions you can jump over to tool.co and\n\n8:14\n\n\nexplore all of the note taking apps and\n\n8:16\n\n\nmuch more and use the filters to narrow\n\n8:18\n\n\ndown your options if you're interested\n\n8:20\n\n\nin case we didn't mention one of them in\n\n8:22\n\n\nthis video so thank you so much for\n\n8:24\n\n\nstopping by I hope you found this\n\n8:26\n\n\nincredibly useful imagine finding a\n\n8:28\n\n\nnotion alternative is right for you I\n\n8:30\n\n\nreally do hope this video did help with\n\n8:32\n\n\nthat so thank you so much I will talk to\n\n8:34\n\n\nyou all very soon folks do subscribe if\n\n8:36\n\n\nyou're brand new and do like this video\n\n8:38\n\n\nif you found it valuable and I'll see\n\n8:40\n\n\nyou in a future video and if you found a\n\n8:42\n\n\nnotion alternative come back to this\n\n8:43\n\n\nvideo and leave a comment because it\n\n8:45\n\n\nalways helps people to find out the best\n\n8:47\n\n\napps on the market so thank you very\n\n8:49\n\n\nmuch and I'll talk to you all very soon\n\n8:51\n\n\ncheerio\n\n8:52\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\n9:04\n\n\nhe\n\n9:07\n\n\n\\[Music\\]\n\nNo results found\n\nTAP TO
